Alright, this one is going to be another one of those that is going to make me feel like this article does not really belong on this blog, but on the other side this might be one of the most important articles I've ever written.

Let's start with a personal story of mine. When the school was over, I was in a bad place mentally, I didn't have friends, a loved person nor any valuable skills to look with confidence in my future.

In short − my future looked gloomy.

The worst of all, I did exhibit the negative body and communication language, which just  wasn't attracting any people or anything good in my life.

In retrospect, it's very easy to catch myself failing or analyze the past behavior in hindsight, but that was definitely not easy back then.

So at this period of my life I was reading different books, and stumbled upon the concept of taking a cold shower in the morning as a habit having many potential upside benefits.

I was intrigued, and curious, so I was willing to try.

The first time I tried it, it went like this:

> OMG, it is so COLD, I'm shieviring! I am shivering!!

The most precise way to describe it, it was like some near-death level of experience, as this was the amount of the shock I did experience voluntarily, but the funny part is I had a such a huge rush in my body thereafter the experience that I started to actually feel positive inside.

It was something totally new, positive emotions starting prevailing over the negative ones in my body and mind, and in the retrospect it made all the difference I needed.

Well, it's hard to describe with words what happened afterwords and all those following years of me consistently taking the cold shower, but I guess it just was a very subtle difference in my facial expression.

I assume the cold exposure started triggering a slight shift in the corner of my lips, they went from a default downward negative position to the upward position, changing everything.

It wasn't an overnight change, but my life trajectory was changed.

Suddenly, people started taking interest in me, offer friendship, spend time together, different offers and opportunities.

It's like I started *magically* attracting people and good things in my life.

Sorry, if that sounds almost too spiritual, but it is the best way I can describe it.

Like for example, I'm in the office, the boss comes in, everybody is sad and gloomy with almost a bitter like face expression I used to have in the past myself, and I'm the only who gets invited to have lunch with him. A couple of weeks later, he asks me, "You look like a guy with great social skills, and everybody seems to like you here in the office, I know it's a bit early for you, but what do you think of the taking the lead developer role in this department further down the line?" − And positive experiences like that started happening to me over and over again.

And what's funny, with that level of positive emotions, hard work − started to feel enjoyable.

It's like the harder I work, [the luckier I get](https://alex-code.com/post/2024-04-15-luck-factor) phenomena I described in a different article.

### Bottom line

There are plenty of benefits of the cold exposure, and you can find a ton of material on this subject on the internet, like for example it's been found that the cold shower is more effective than all the antidepressants on the market, and not only that, but it is also free and has no downsides − not something big pharma would be happy about.

I'm just sharing my experience as all I care about, is that it had a positive life-changing effect on my life, so you might benefit from it as well.
