Alright, this one is going to be another one of those that is going to make me feel like this article does not really belong on this blog, but on the other side this might be one of the most important articles I have ever written.

Let's start with a personal story of mine. When the school was over, I was in a bad place mentally, I didn't have friends, a loved person nor any valuable skills to look with confidence in my future.

In short âˆ’ my future looked gloomy.

The worst of all, I did exhibit the negative body and communication language, which just  wasn't attracting any people or anything good in my life.

In retrospect, it's very easy to catch myself failing or analyze the past behavior in hindsight, but that was definitely not easy back then.

So at this period of my life I was reading different books, and stumbled upon the concept of taking a cold shower in the morning as a habit having many upsides benefits.

I was intrigued, and curious, so I was willing to try.

The first time I tried it, it went like this:

> OMG, it is so COLD, I'm shieviring, I am shivering

The most precise way to describe it was like some near-death level of experience, as this was the amount of the shock I did experience voluntarily, but the funny part is I had a such a huge rush in my body thereafter the experience that I started to actually feel positive inside.

It was something totally new, positive emotions starting prevailing over the negative ones in my body and mind, and in the retrospect it made all the difference I needed.

Well, it's hard to describe with words what happened afterwords and all those following years of me consistently taking the cold shower, but I guess it just was a very subtle difference in my facial expression.

I assume the cold exposure started triggering a slight shift in the corner of my lips,
