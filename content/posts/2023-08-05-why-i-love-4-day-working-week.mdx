Backstory: After my first internship at my first tech job ended, my salary doubled overnight since I was only receiving half the pay during the internship.

And do you know what kind of thoughts I had this day? Hell, if my time worth just doubled, does it mean I can work twice as less?

Of course, I could not because in software companies you are expected to work long hours, so those companies can max out the potential of every single ðŸ§  brain cell you have.

However, I did succeed at negotiating a 4-day week. I mean, I'm not going to lie it was not that easy. It took me some back and forth, but eventually, after a couple of meetings with my manager, boss, and HR, I explained my point, got the approval, and created the first precedent of this work schedule inside the company.

### What about money?

This schedule requires a 20% pay cut, and surprisingly, all of my colleagues thought I must be ðŸ™ˆ bananas to undergo such a cut. But it was also odd to me at the same time, as I was curious, why people did not value their free time?

To be honest, a 20% cut is not that of a big of a deal. This is not going to ruin your ðŸ’Ž luxury ðŸ’¼ lifestyle, as you are already working in tech and probably making an above-average wage.

So in my case, as I'm a minimalist and I don't buy stupid stuff I don't need, I didn't have to starve or limit myself with anything by switching to a 4-day workweek schedule.

(I was fine financially even during my internship when I was making way less money, as it's all about having common sense with your finances)

I mean, what's the point of making all this big tech money if you don't have time to spend and enjoy it anyways?

It's just more time for fun and cool activities.

### What are some perks of this schedule?

**Travel** â€“ So the big problem with the traditional Monday to Friday schedule is that it leaves you with 2 days off, but the problem is, whenever you want to organize any kind of getaway you're likely to spend one day on the road, so it actually leaves you with a single day of travelling.

And you know what is even worse? Getting back from this mini trip spending the rest of the free time on the road not being able to properly recovery for the upcoming workweek. Such a drag!

One extra day off when working a 4-day workweek was a game changer for my mini trips. To properly visit the place, I was interested in, and get back to work feeling refreshed.

**Leisure** â€“ The opportunity for extra time to read books and hit the gym more often, so I can extend my youthful time it just ðŸ¤© incredible!

**Study** - With the given freedom, I was more excited about studying tech outside my regular workings hours, as I was not so tired after my work, as my colleagues were. So, ironically, when the time came for performance evaluation at my company, I outscored my peers and received a higher raise for my ðŸ“– knowledge, so basically, with this raise I was making the same amount of money working a 4-day week as they were while working a traditional 5-day workweek.

A little bit ironic, don't you think so? ðŸ˜…
