Before reading this article any further, I would suggest jumping off my blog and checking the Author's [TED talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iFCm5ZokBI), as the actual picture a thousand of words.

I am a huge fun of any book that can increase the quality of my life, and this is the ONE, as it was a mind-changing one for me.

Don't get me wrong, I like fun at work, but sometimes it was hard to strike the balance to figure how much humor is too much or whether a certain joke is appropriate for a certain job meeting.

However, this book comes with really quality answers for those questions.

### Humor benefits

Let's start from the mindset shift.

Did you know that humor:

1. Humor improves productivity
2. Humor reduces stress.
3. Humor prevents burnout
4. Humor provides motivation
5. Humor increases size of paycheck

...

And it's only the start!

There are actually [30 scientifically proven](https://www.humorthatworks.com/benefits/30-benefits-of-humor-at-work/) benefits to humor.

### I am afraid to joke at work

This is a really interesting point, and it's quite easy to understand you.

But what those studies found is that when you joke and other people laugh, it actually increases your perceived level of competence.

And what's more surprising is when other people don't actually laugh at your joke, it makes ZERO difference in your perceived level of competence and credibility, so you actually have nothing to lose, but only to gain!

You need to actually practice humor because that's the only way you can get better at it!

### Notes on the book structure

It is fun (as you can already expect)

It is short and straight to the business

And it teaches you something you probably didn't know before.
