Before reading this article any further, I would suggest jumping off my blog and checking the Author's [TED talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iFCm5ZokBI), as the actual picture worth a thousand of words.

I am a huge fun of any book that can increase the quality of my life, and take me to the next level in something, and this was definitely the one, as I updated my views on certain things topics after reading this book.

I like fun at work, but sometimes it was hard to strike the balance to figure how much humor is too much or whether a certain joke is appropriate for a certain job meeting.

And this book came with really high-quality answers for those questions.

So let's firstly explore the humor benefits.

### Humor benefits

Let's start from the mindset shift.

Did you know that humor:

1. Humor improves productivity
2. Humor reduces stress.
3. Humor prevents burnout
4. Humor provides motivation
5. Humor increases size of paycheck

And it's only the tip of the iceberg!

There are actually 30 scientifically proven benefits to humor. ([source](https://www.humorthatworks.com/benefits/30-benefits-of-humor-at-work/))

### What if I am afraid to joke at work?

Previous excerpt might have got you interested, but what if you are just afraid to joke?

This is a really interesting point to cover, and it's quite easy to understand you.

What those studies also found is that when you joke and other people laugh, it actually **increases your perceived level of competence**.

And what's more surprising is when other people don't actually laugh at your joke, **it makes zero** difference in your perceived level of competence and credibility, as people do not notice it and just go about their, so you actually have nothing to lose, but only to gain!

You need to actually practice humor because that's the only way you can get better at it!

Let's say at work, we have two people, Rebecca and Alex.

Rebecca is just not fun because she never jokes, and she will never be, as she does not even try.

Alex, on the other hand, practices humor most of the time, with everyone. If his joke did not work with one coworker, he's searching for a way to reiterate by changing his voice tonality and make the next coworker die from laughter.

And it worked for Alex because he believed deep down that his initial joke was good. It just needed a better delivery, so by slightly alternating his voice tonality, he made someone else's day better by making this person feeling positive and smiling.

And that's exactly why Alex is funny while Rebecca is not.

All because Alex is constantly alternating his approach, which leads to better results.

### Practical examples
