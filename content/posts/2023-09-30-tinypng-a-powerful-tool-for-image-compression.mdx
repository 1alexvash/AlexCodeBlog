Have you ever encountered the problem of having numerous images on your web application consuming a significant portion of your storage space and causing sluggish loading times? If so, TinyPNG is the solution you've been searching for.

TinyPNG uses smart lossy compression techniques to reduce the file size of your WEBP, JPEG and PNG files. By selectively decreasing the number of colors in the image, fewer bytes are required to store the data. The effect is nearly invisible but it makes a very large difference in file size!

To illustrate the efficacy of TinyPNG, consider the example provided on their official website:
