I recently found a fun VSCode extension to make your code more presentable.

It is called [CodeSnap](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=adpyke.codesnap), and it converts your selected code into a nice sharable presentable image.

Just compare the image on the left with the one produced by this extension on the right.

Which one would you like to receive from your colleague?

I would definitely prefer to receive the image on the right from my coworker, as this beautiful syntax highlighting makes it way easier to understand the shared piece of code rather than just plain unformatted text.

It is a small thing, but it makes collaboration way easier.

This extension can also become very handy for your presentations, as with it, you'll be able to create beautiful code slides matching the exact VSCode style, which will make them very relatable for other developers.
