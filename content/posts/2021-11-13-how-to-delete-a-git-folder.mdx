```bash
rm -rf .git
```

Let's examine the code we wrote to get a little bit better understanding.

**rm** stands for remove, pretty straightforward.

**-r** flag means recursively to target all files, and **-f** means force to pass through all warnings.

(This flag ensures the command will be executed properly)

**.git** the invisible file we want to target.

### Why deleting a git folder?

Well, use cases can be different, but basically, it is a convenient command for resetting git history, so you can then run

```bash
git init
```

And reinitialize the repo.

### Alternative

Git folder is by default invisible on Windows, so you can make it visible via this setting.

Step one: find folder options in the windows start menu:
