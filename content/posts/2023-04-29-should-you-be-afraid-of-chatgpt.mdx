No, you shouldn't be afraid of ChatGPT.

Actually, you should be happy about new technology, embrace it and max out its full potential.

I know seeing this tool is very intimidating, as so far we haven't seen anything capable of generating human - like language smart enough to pass [the Turing Test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test).

It even scarier seeing this tool generating code, no wonder you start wondering whether this tool will replace your programming job any time soon.

However, we need to understand the general trend that access to higher quality information is getting easier.

### It isn't as bad as it seems.

What I've found in my personal experience it isn't as good for generating code as it looks at the first glance.

For a couple of reasons:

Firstly, at my work I work on a somewhat big of a TypeScript enterprise application and in there we have layers on top of layers of different libraries and packages, so to write any code in there you need to be aware of all of those context intricacies just to make anything work, and in this case, ChatGPT isn't much of a use. Though on the other hand, GitHub Copilot does an amazing job on a more local level, so AI still helps there.

Secondly, chat is hallucinating sometimes when it thinks it gets some piece of code right when it is actually not, so you have to dive into the prompting rabbit hole to extract needed information. Not perfect, but still sometimes nicer than going in Stack Overflow's rabbit hole.

Thirdly, there's a Chat's training cut-off date. Which is not ideal for JavaScript devs, for example, as often times you have to work with cutting-edge stuff, so the framework or library released in 2021 might be ancient in the JS world by today. Thus, it is just something to keep in mind as It might not know what's the latest buzz or even throw some old code at you.

I mean it's not perfect for coding yet, but it is great for general search queries.

To me, it feels more like a [replacement for Google](https://alex-code.com/post/2023-04-22-why-chatgpt-is-better-than-google) rather than for programmers.

### So, what should I do about it?

Take advantage of it, obviously!

Our lives will be more and more intertwined with AI as the time goes on.

This is one thing for sure we can be confident in.

I actually find the GitHub Copilot more useful for me when it comes to coding, but ChatGPT just gives me another edge for my productivity.

Not having that extra edge is actually what you should be scared of.

I guess this meme sums it up:
