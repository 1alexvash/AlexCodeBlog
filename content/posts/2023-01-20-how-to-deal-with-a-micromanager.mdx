Let's say at your work you have Lily, and she is a micromanager.

She is nice and all, but sometimes she gets annoying as hell, so you'd like to know how to deal with her.

It all sounds good, but let's take a spin, and look at this from the manager perspective, as from yours it probably just looks like I'm doing my job, trying to get focused, so why is she distracting me all the time?

### Nature of manager

Let's start off with the fact that your manager has a boss. Everyone has a boss. And she has to report to him or her about your work further down the chain.

If everything is good, she gets praised, otherwise criticized.

So right there you can see her incentives for your work being done well.

Just imagine. If Lily gets asked by her boss, about some important feature we promised to deliver weeks ago, what she is going to do?

What if she gets asked multiply times a day? Probably even outside the work time as the client might be threatening to cut the pay or some other bad stuff, you don't want to deal with as a developer.

Well, then her reaction is obvious.

I call it **harassment chain.**

The good part you can totally reverse it, so let's dive into the solution.

### Solution

<u>Overreporting.</u>

It's totally out of the blue, out of the script, as it is traditionally her job to get to you and collect the important information, and that's why it is effective.

If you are going to bring her information before she even asks, just imagine how much calmer, and relaxed she will be.

If she has all the answers before she even starts talking to you, then there's nothing to be upset or angry about regarding any unmet expectations.

### Rule of thumb

A very nice rule of thumb, is to report as much as you can until you get asked to report less.

### How to do it

Just send her daily, and weekly updates. As a bonus, it's going to serve as a great foundation for your promotion, as you can just go through the list of all your updates, and list out your greatest achievements at work.

With that attitude, everybody is just going to fall in love with you, and your work is just going to be pure pleasure from then on.
