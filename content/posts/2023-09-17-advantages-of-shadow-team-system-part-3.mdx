In the [previous](https://alex-code.com/post/2023-08-23-is-shadow-team-ethical-part-2) article, we touched upon whether the shadow team business model is ethical, and the answer turned out to be more complicated than we could possibly expect.

In this article, we will dissect another interesting question: who benefits from this model, and the answer is going to be way more interesting than you can possibly expect.

### 4 sides of shadow team

![](</post-images/Advantages of Shadow Team system ILLUSTRATION 4 sides of shadow team.png>)

To start off, let's name all the sides participating in this process.

First, we got the `client` who's ordering the project.

Second, we got the `agency / company` that's incentivizing such this business model in the first place.

Thirdly, it's a `mentor`. The person who negotiates the contract and oversees the handover of tasks to the Ninja.

Lastly, it is our so-called `Ninja` who does the bulk of the work but stays behind the shadows of mentor's glory.

### üë®‚Äçüíº Client

The first character in this play is the client, and the client doesn't really care about who does the work. It's not like you leave some special fingerprint on your work.

What does actually the client cares about: ‚úÖ

* Cost
* Quality
* Deadlines
* Their business
* On time work updates
* Soft-skills and communication

As you can see, the client does not really care about who does the work. It just not on the horizon of his interests.

So in this scenario, the client wins on everything, as he gets the better quality of work from the guy with "hard-skills", and better communication from the "soft-skills" guy.

### üè¢ Agency

What all those Upwork companies really care about is maximizing profits and customer's satisfaction, so this business concept hits the spot perfectly.

But, as I had experience working in such an agency and seeing both sides of the delegation process. I have a unique perspective on some other interesting benefits for the agency organizing such a business model.

* Bench minimization

You never really know how many people are working "in the shadows" of the project. It can be one, two, and even more in certain cases.

As an agency typically has dozens of projects and dozens of people on it. This model helps to rotate people to minimize bench time, which hurts the agency in numerous ways: Firstly, temporarily unworking workers drive the cost of the agency, and the cost of its services for the client. Secondly, disengaged individuals without an assigned project to work on might get bored, and start to look for other opportunities elsewhere. This is especially painful as it was hard to hire those talents in the first place.

* Education for the new team member

There's this famous catch 22 where to get a first job you already need to have some experience. For agencies, it is actually a great opportunity, as it allows them to hire less experienced members inside the shadow team, and test them there, as there's usually a lesser chance of them publicly screwing up in front of the client.

* Company growth

This one is funny, but this way it is easier for agencies to scale their size. As it is easier at first to get a new team member inside the shadow team, and then promote them to the mentor, and then hire another new team member, and üîÅ repeat the process.

### üë®‚Äçüéì Mentor

For the mentor, this role might look like a drag once they asked to perform such a duty, but if they do their job well, they actually win a lot.

* Leveling up delegation skill

This is your first step towards becoming a team-lead or even a manager, as you are just gaining your first experience in it.

* Business skills

Increased client communication leads to better understanding of their priorities, which, in turn, boosts your value and compensation as you address their critical needs.

* Improved estimation skill

The more you delegate, the better idea you have on how long development will take. The better you are at estimating, the lower the risks for your client, and so clients become willing to pay you even more and stay with you longer

(Going back to the previous point about high-quality work)

* Improved communication and explanation skills

This role will require the development of great communication skills, as you're going to be between the client and the ninja, so you will have to communicate everything precisely, as every misunderstanding and mistake will be very time - costly for everybody.

But, if you can get good at talking and communicating, then you'll notice every area of your life improving, not only work stuff!

* Career growth

As you start to manage other people, you will be naturally seen as a leader and promoted in no time.

* Interesting solutions

Another benefit is not something you would normally expect from a junior member of the team, but I saw it happening plenty of times. When senior members of the project are discussing a new big task of a size mountain, and then a ninja suggests, "Oh, guys let's not climb the mountain, but walk past it, there's this cool solution which will take only a fraction of time".

This is something that happens quite a lot when you bring people with a diverse experience and approaches to problems, and as the shadow team model brings people together working on different problems, it is something you might expect to happen quite a lot.

You never really know the way the Ninja in your shadow team might approach the problem. This outside the box thinking might open up your eyes to some unique approaches to solve the problem at hand.

* More interesting tasks

As a Mentor, you get to pick what task to work on, and which task to delegate to the Ninja, so you essentially can pick more interesting tasks for yourself while leaving boring ones to the Ninja, so you **level up** your tech skills way **faster** working on more **interesting** tasks.

### ü•∑ Ninja

* First job experience

As already mentioned, it is less risky for the company to hire you in shadow team, so they will ask for less tech skills during the interview, and it is your chance to get the first job.

* Fast learning

Initially, you will be assigned a mentor, who will teach you the best approaches and tools to use. So you are going to experience one of the fastest learning experiences in your life.

* Knowledge sharing

In this model, as a ninja you might jump from a mentor to mentor, from project to project, so you will definitely see quite a few approaches of doing things.

* Experimenting with new technologies

Also, goes along the previous one. Quickly switching stuff up means trying many new things.

### How did we get there

It is also interesting to examine on how did we arrive with such a business model in the first place?

So first it starts off from client ordering the project to optimize his/her business and take it to another level by making more money.

And we need to remember for business, money is like ü©∏ blood. Without it simply dies.

But the problem is that local tech service is expensive here in the area, so clients naturally turn their options somewhere typically üåä overseas.

However, not all people from those countries poses the right amount of technical and communication skills to convince the client into working with them, so overtime they start to organize into those groups / agencies where one person who's good at talking gets the project and gives it to the person who is got at the actual  craft to do the job.

And that's how we got there!

### The bottom line:

The shadow team business model is an unusual one.

There are some bad things about it, but there are also some good things about it like apprenticeship in this model is taking up to an extreme.

It might appear a bit awkward depending on the stage of transparency of those agencies. But at the of the day, if the work quality is good, and all sides are happy, then I don't really care about the details.

You might very well encounter such a job at the very beginning of your career.

And with the current conditions of the market, this model is likely to stay, so it's good to be aware of it.

In case you order some cheap Upwork project in India, and there's something funny going on with the communication part on their side, you might know what's up üòâ
