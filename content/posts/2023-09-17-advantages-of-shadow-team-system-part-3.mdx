In the [previous](https://alex-code.com/post/2023-08-23-is-shadow-team-ethical-part-2) article, we touched upon whether the shadow team business model is ethical, and the answer turned out to be more complicated than we could possibly expect.

In this article, we will dissect another interesting question: who benefits from this model, and the answer is going to be way more interesting than you can possibly expect.

### 4 sides of shadow team

To start off, let's name all the sides participating in this process.

First, we got the `client` who's ordering the project.

Second, we got the `agency` that's incentivizing such this business model in the first place.

Thirdly, it's a `mentor`. The person who negotiates the contract and oversees the handover of tasks to the next person.

Lastly, it's our so-called `Ninja` who does the bulk of the work but stays behind the shadows of mentor's glory.

### üë®‚Äçüíº Client

The first character is the client, and the client doesn't really care about who does the work. It's not like you leave some special fingerprint on your work.

What does actually the client cares about:

* Costs
* Quality
* Deadlines
* Their business
* On time work updates
* Soft-skills and communication

In this universe, the client wins on everything, as he gets the better quality of work from the "hard-skills" guy, and better communication from the "soft-skills" guy.

### üè¢ Agency

What all those Upwork companies really care about is maximizing profits and customer's satisfaction, so this business concept hits the spot perfectly.

But, as I had experience working in such an agency and seeing both sides of the delegation process. I have a unique perspective on some other interesting benefits for the agency organizing such a process.

* Bench minimization

You never really know how many people are working "in the shadows" of the project. It can be one, two, and even more in certain cases.

As an agency typically has dozens of projects and dozens of people on it. This model helps to rotate people to minimize bench time, which hurts the agency in numerous ways: Firstly, temporarily unworking workers drive the cost of the agency, and the cost of its services for the client. Secondly, disengaged individuals without an assigned project to work on might get bored, and start to look for other opportunities elsewhere. This is especially painful as it was hard to hire those talents in the first place.

* Education for the new team member

There's this famous catch 22 where to get a first job you already need to have some experience. For agencies, it is actually a great opportunity, as it allows them to hire less experienced members inside the shadow team, and test them there, as there's usually a lesser chance of them publicly screwing up in front of the client.

* Company growth

This one is funny, but this way it is easier for agencies to scale their size. As it easier at first to get a new team member inside the shadow team, and then promote them to the mentor, and then hire another new team member, and üîÅ repeat the process.

### üë®‚Äçüéì Mentor

For the mentor, this role might look like a drag once they asked to perform such a duty, but if they do their job well they actually win a lot.

* Leveling up delegation skill

This is your first step towards becoming a team-lead or even a manager, as you are just gaining your first experience in it.

* Business skills

The greater your communication with the client, the better your understanding of their business priorities becomes. The more assistance you provide in addressing these critical needs, the higher the value the client places on your contributions, resulting in increased compensation.

* Improved estimation skill

The more you delegate, the better idea you have on how long development will take. The better you are at estimating, the lower the risks for your client, and so they are ready to pay you even more

(Going back to the previous point about high-quality work)

* Improved communication and explanation skills

This role will require the development of great communication skills, as you're going to be between the client and the ninja, so you will have to communicate everything precisely, as every misunderstanding and mistake will be costly for everybody.

But, if you can get good at talking, then you'll notice every area of your life improving, not only work stuff!

* Career growth

As you start to manage other people, you will be naturally seen as a leader and promoted in no time.

* Interesting solutions

You never really know the way the Ninja in your shadow team might approach the problem. This outside the box thinking might open up your eyes to some unique approaches to solve the problem at hand.

* More interesting tasks

As a Mentor, you get to pick what task to work on, and which task to delegate to the Ninja, so you essentially can pick more interesting tasks for yourself while leaving boring ones to the Ninja, so you level up your tech skills way faster working on more interesting tasks.

### ü•∑ Ninja

* First job experience

As already mentioned, it is less risky for the company to hire you in shadow team, so they will ask for less tech skills during the interview

* Fast learning

Initially, you will be assigned a mentor, who's will teach you the best approaches and tools to use. So you are going to experience one of the fastest learning experiences in your life.

* Knowledge sharing

In this model, as a ninja you might jump from a mentor to mentor, so you will definitely see quite a few approaches of doing things

* Experimenting with new technologies

Also, goes along the previous one. Moving from mentor to mentor implies trying working in many new projects, therefore trying many new technologies as well.

### The bottom line: 

The shadow team business model might appear unconventional, it depends on to what extent business is open about hidden members. But, even though in the shadow team model, this delegation model is taken up to an extreme, you will still encounter similar models in other businesses.

It just that this approach is usually taken up to an extreme in agencies.

However, as we already discussed, they are not guilty ones. They are just doing their best to optimally serve the market needs.
