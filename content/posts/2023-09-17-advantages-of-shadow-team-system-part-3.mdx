In the previous article, we touched upon whether the shadow team business model is ethical, and the answer turned out to be more complicated than we could possibly expect.

In this article, we will dissect another interesting question: who benefits from this model, and the answer is going to be way more interesting than you can possibly expect.

### 4 sides of shadow team

So, to start off, let's name all the sides participating in this process (there are more of them that come to mind).

First, we've got the `client` who's ordering the project.

Second, we've got the `agency` that's incentivizing such a model in the first place.

Thirdly, it's a `mentor`. The person who negotiates the contract and oversees the handover of tasks to the next person.

Lastly, it's our so-called `Ninja` who does the bulk of the work but stays behind the shadows of Mentor's glory.

### Client's perspective

Actually, the client doesn't really care about who does the work. It's not like you leave some special fingerprint on your work.

What does actually the client cares about:

* Quality
* Deadlines
* Their business
* On time updates
* Soft-skills and communication

In this universe, the client wins on everything, as he gets the better quality of work from the "hard-skills" guy, and better communication from the "soft-skills" guy.

### Agency

What all those Upwork companies really care about is maximizing profits and customer's satisfaction, so this business concept hits the spot perfectly.

But, as I had experience working in such an agency and seeing both sides of the delegation process. I have a unique perspective on some other interesting benefits for the agency organizing such a process.
