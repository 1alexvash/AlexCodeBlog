In the [previous](https://alex-code.com/post/2023-08-23-is-shadow-team-ethical-part-2) article, we touched upon whether the shadow team business model is ethical, and the answer turned out to be more complicated than we could possibly expect.

In this article, we will dissect another interesting question: who benefits from this model, and the answer is going to be way more interesting than you can possibly expect.

### 4 sides of shadow team

So, to start off, let's name all the sides participating in this process (there are more of them that come to mind).

First, we've got the `client` who's ordering the project.

Second, we've got the `agency` that's incentivizing such a model in the first place.

Thirdly, it's a `mentor`. The person who negotiates the contract and oversees the handover of tasks to the next person.

Lastly, it's our so-called `Ninja` who does the bulk of the work but stays behind the shadows of Mentor's glory.

### Client

Actually, the client doesn't really care about who does the work. It's not like you leave some special fingerprint on your work.

What does actually the client cares about:

* Quality
* Deadlines
* Their business
* On time updates
* Soft-skills and communication

In this universe, the client wins on everything, as he gets the better quality of work from the "hard-skills" guy, and better communication from the "soft-skills" guy.

### Agency

What all those Upwork companies really care about is maximizing profits and customer's satisfaction, so this business concept hits the spot perfectly.

But, as I had experience working in such an agency and seeing both sides of the delegation process. I have a unique perspective on some other interesting benefits for the agency organizing such a process.

* Bench minimization

You never really know how many people are working "in the shadows" of the project. It can be one, two, and even more in certain cases.

As an agency typically have dozens of projects and dozens of people on it. This model helps to rotate people to minimize bench time which hurts the agency in numerous ways: Firstly, temporarily unworking workers drive the cost of the agency, and the cost of its services for the client. Secondly, disengaged individuals without assigned project to work on migh get bored, and looking for other opportunities elsewhere. This is painful as it was hard to hire them in the first place.

* Education for the new team member

There's this famous catch 22 where to get a first job you already need to have some experience. For agencies, it is actually a great opportunity, as it allows them to hire less experienced members inside the shadow, as there's usually a lesser chance of them publicly screwing up in front of the client.

* Company growth

This one is funny, but this way it easier for agencies to scale their size. As it easier to get a new team member in this model, and then promote to the mentor, and then hire another team member.

### Mentor

For the mentor, this role might look like a drag once they asked to perform such a job, but I promise if they do their job good they will win a lot!

* Leveling up delegation skill

This is your first step towards becoming a team-lead or even a manager, as you are just gaining your first experience.

* Business skills

The more you communicate to the client the more you know what actually is important for the bussiness of your client. The more help you do towards that, the more client values you for doing the dumb work, so you get to paid more.

* Improved estimation skill

The more you delegate, the better idea you have about how long developing something will take. The better you are at estimating the lower risks for your client, and they are ready to pay more and work with your if you can prove that. (Going back to the previous point)

* Improved communication and explanation skills

This role switch will require you to improve your articulation skills, as you're going to be between the client and ninja, so you will have to communicate everything precisely, as every misunderstanding will be costly just for everybody.

But, if you can get good at talking then you'll notice every area of your life improving, not only work stuff!

* Career growth

As you start to manager other people, you will be naturally seen as a leader and promoted in no time.

* Interesting solutions

You never really know the way the Ninja in your shadow team might approach the problem. This outside the box thinking might open up your eyes to some unique approaches to solve the problem at hand.

* More interesting tasks

As a Mentor, you get to pick what task to work on, and which task to delegate to the Ninja, so you essentially can pick more interesting tasks for yourself while leaving boring ones to the Ninja, so you level your tech skills way faster working on interesting tasks.

### Ninja

* First job experience

As already mentioned, it is less risky for the company to hire you in shadow team, so they will ask require for less tech skills during the interview

* Learning fast

Initially, you will be assigned a mentor, who's going to teach you the best approaches and tools to use. So you are going to experience one of the fastest learning experiences in your life.

* Knowledge sharing

As you get to work together with the mentor on the project,       .............

Experimenting with new technologies / approaches
