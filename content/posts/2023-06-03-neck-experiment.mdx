first apporach scary

(but then it was like this is the most fun I ever had, I with I'd approach even more people)

then it got fun

I increased difficulty

never approached so many people in my life

headphones girl 1 and then the second one

grocery

at the bar

approaching two girls, but only asking the opinion of a single one

some girls literally pointed the screen on the right side

the point is subtle perception matters vastly

People were engaged and interested

(every single interaction went fun and positevely)

Nobody notified a difference even when specifically asked...
