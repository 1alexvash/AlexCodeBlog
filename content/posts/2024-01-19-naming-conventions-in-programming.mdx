There are four main programming conventions, and they go by even more funnier names.

![](</post-images/Naming conventions in programing ILLUSTRATION.png>)

You don't necessarily need to know them by name, but at least you need to be aware of them.

Otherwise, your code is just going to create a massive confusion for your readers if used inappropriately, and you definitely don't want that look on their faces!

### For instance

In Python, there's a well established **snake\_case** convention (hence the name Python, lol).

So you typically write your variables and methods like this: `perform_work`, `execute_operation`, and `clean_and_reboot`.

While in JavaScript, the established convention is **camelCase**.

So the big point here is don't mix those two, and make your JavaScript code look like Python like in the example down below.

❎

```javascript
const math_add = (a, b) => {
  return a + b;
};

const math_subtract = (a, b) => {
  return a - b;
};

const math_multiply = (a, b) => {
  return a * b;
};

const math_divide = (a, b) => {
  return a / b;
};
```

Instead, let's rewrite it with proper convention for JavaScript.

✅

```javascript
const mathAdd = (a, b) => {
  return a + b;
};

const mathSubtract = (a, b) => {
  return a - b;
};

const mathMultiply = (a, b) => {
  return a * b;
};

const mathDivide = (a, b) => {
  return a / b;
};
```

Way clearer and easier to read!

Hence, that what we are used to in the JavaScript world.

### Summary

Use a proper naming convention inside your language to make the code more maintainable, and familiar.

Also, for God's sake, don't mix multiply conventions inside a single file. Ambiguity like this will make your code instantly classified as a shitty code.
