There are four main programming conventions, and they go by even more funnier names.

![](</post-images/Naming conventions in programing ILLUSTRATION.png>)

You don't necessarily to know them by name, but at least you need to be aware of them.

Otherwise, your code is just going to create a massive confusion for your readers, and you definitely don't want that look on their faces!

### For instance

In Python, there's a well established snake\_case convention (hence the name Python, lol).

So you typically write your variables like this: perform\_work, execute\_operation, and clean\_and\_reboot.

While in JavaScript, the established convention is **camelCase**.

So the big point: don't mix those two, and make our JavaScript code look like Python (Do you remember about massive confusion?)

❎

```javascript
const math_add = (a, b) => {
  return a + b;
};

const math_subtract = (a, b) => {
  return a - b;
};

const math_multiply = (a, b) => {
  return a * b;
};

const math_divide = (a, b) => {
  return a / b;
};
```

Instead, use a proper convention for your language.

✅

```javascript
const mathAdd = (a, b) => {
  return a + b;
};

const mathSubtract = (a, b) => {
  return a - b;
};

const mathMultiply = (a, b) => {
  return a * b;
};

const mathDivide = (a, b) => {
  return a / b;
};
```
