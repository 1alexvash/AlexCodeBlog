Uhh, TypeScript.

I love TypeScript, though I used to really hate it.

So if you are in similar position right now, I am definitely the guy who can relate.

My hate to love changed in a matter of a single month. What changed, you might ask? That's a good question. I simply started using it, basic AF, I know.

But hear me out on this one. You're not going to get good at things you have no actual experience. It's like expecting to learn to play the guitar without touching one. This kind of wishful thinking isn't going to work.

## But TypeScript sucks!

Nope. It just requires a different kind of thinking.

It's like comparing JavaScript to Java even though they sound the same, they are not.

I promise, after using TS for some time you won't be able to get back to regular to JS.

I'm looking back at my old JS code, and it just doesn't feel right. The code hasn't got those cute types, so it is less secure, and I can't wrap my head around to figure what is about.

## It all sounds good

After reading this article, you've probably got the feeling like I'm a huge advocate of TypeScript and probably sponsored by them. (Sadly but no)

But I'm a real proponent of this technology because it makes my life as a software developer easier.

You won't find a better piece of advice on the internet about learning TypeScript. Here it is: **Just start using it**.

I know it all can sound inspiring, but there are some real intricacies, and it can be cumbersome just starting out working with types, especially when your code editor overflows with those annoying errors.

So stay tuned, and check out my future articles, where I'm going to dive deeper into this topic.
