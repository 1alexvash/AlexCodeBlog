Backstory: prior to [Tina CMS](https://tina.io/) on this blog, I tried WordPress and Netlify CMS, and in short, they both suck.

I mean, Tina CMS is still not perfect, as it has a couple of flaws I am going to describe further down in this article, but still, it has one killer feature that makes all the difference.

### Live content editing

(This is pure magic ðŸ”¥)

### What sucks

Despite, it's core feature which really carries the overall impression of TinaCMS it still has a few nuances here and there that make it not so perfect.

And here they are:

1. Despite being based on the React platform, it still not as easy in terms of integration as the forementioned NetlifyCMS for example
2. TypeScript is not a first class citizen inside TinaCMS, so if your project is based on React + TypeScript stack you are going to have a fun time extracting those types which will make the existing integration even harder.
3. It has a few weird bugs, one of them is when you write an article and accidentally close the tab. It closes the page without any warning about lost progress. I did report this bug a long time ago inside the community, but they don't seem to fix it any time soon.
4. There are a couple of issues with renaming I did report as well, for example, when you rename a file, and it has invalid characters or there's a file with a similar name. The website just crashes, instead of just giving a beautiful validation error in advance.
5. The media manager is terrible if you ever uploaded picture inside of your content management system, finding it is the pain in the back, as there's no built-in search feature, for example, so you are better off skipping this process, and trying to find this picture on your computer and then uploading again.

### Summary

In summary, I happened to reimplemented my website 3 times, first time I created a WordPress template, but it was too heavy, slow, and the content looked differently after the actual save for some fucked up reason, also it had too many features, and it just did not work the way I expected. Next I went into trying [Netlify CMS](https://alex-code.com/post/2023-06-06-why-you-should-not-use-netlify-cms) which promised a minimalistic interface, but even despite having only a few features in its core, it still struggled to deliver them.

So my encounter with Tina CMS was a perfect match in heaven, even despite its occasional flaws here and there, it is still perfect for me, and does make a massive difference in terms of writing speed and writing comfort, and that's all that matters for a writer.
