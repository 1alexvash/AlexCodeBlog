Hashmap is a famous data structure.

Joma Tech, for example, loves using it in his videos for jokes, this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bId3N7QZec) is my favorite one.

There might have been some confusion, as in developing circles you might have heard this term quite often while not knowing exactly what it is.
