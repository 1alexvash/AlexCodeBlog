Hashmap is a famous data structure.

Joma Tech, for example, loves using it in his videos for jokes, this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bId3N7QZec) is my favorite one.

There might have been some confusion, as in developing circles you might have heard this term quite often while not knowing exactly what it is. That's true, as Hashmap is actually a data structure from Python. The closest we've got in JavaScript is an object. But, if you want to learn more. It'll be good for you to understand this term to navigate more smoothly around all data structures topic.

### So what is Hashmap?

![](/post-images/hashmap-illustration.png)

Imagine we have a street with houses on it.

Each house is locked, and to open them you need a key, every house has a unique key to open it.

That's what essentially a Hashmap is, a pair of values: key and value.

### How to implement it?

As already mentioned, Hashmap is not really a JavaScript structure, but you still might need the knowledge about it, especially when it comes to interviews, knowing data structures or doing LeetCode tasks.

And the very nasty fact about JavaScript is that it has a mix of programming paradigms under its core. Which means two very opposite things: First good one, it's very easy to get started with it, and the second is a bad one, it's extremely hard to master it, every framework does not look like JavaScript but like another new language in itself, as there's a myriad of ways to do the same thing.

So let's go over a couple of ways we can implement this data structure

### 1) Basic JavaScript object:

```javascript
const houses = {
  key1: 'First House',
  key2: 'Second House',
  key3: 'Third House',
  key4: 'Fourth House',
  key5: 'Fifth House',
};
```

### 2) JavaSciript map structure introduced in ES6

```javascript
const houses = new Map([
  ["key1", "First House"],
  ["key2", "Second House"],
  ["key3", "Third House"],
  ["key4", "Fourth House"],
  ["key5", "Fifth House"],
]);


houses.get("key1"); // First House
```

This one has some advantage of additional methods like get, set, and delete so it gives yo a better mental model of the actual Hashmap.

### 3) And lastly the TypeScript implementation

```typescript
type HouseKeys = 'key1' | 'key2' | 'key3' | 'key4' | 'key5';

const houses: Record<HouseKeys, string> = {
  key1: 'First House',
  key2: 'Second House',
  key3: 'Third House',
  key4: 'Fourth House',
  key5: 'Fifth House',
};
```
