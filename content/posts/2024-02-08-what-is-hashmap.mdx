Hashmap is a famous data structure.

Joma Tech, for example, loves using it in his videos for jokes, this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bId3N7QZec) is my favorite one.

There might have been some confusion, as in developing circles you might have heard this term quite often while not knowing exactly what it is. That's true as Hashmap is actually a data structure from Python. The closest we've got in JavaScript is an object. But, if you are looking to level up your knowledge, it's good to understand the terminology as you're going to better understand the whole data structures concept.

### So what is Hashmap?

@illustration

Imagine we have a street with houses on it.

Each house is locked, and to open them you need a key, every house has a unique key to open it.

That's what essentially a Hashmap is, a pair of values: key and value.

### How to implement it?

As already mentioned, Hashmap is not really a JavaScript structure, but you still might need the knowledge about it, especially when it comes to interviews, knowing data structures or doing LeetCode tasks.

And the very nasty fact about JavaScript is that it has a mix of programming paradigms under its core. Which means two very opposite things: First good one, it's very easy to get started with it, and the second is a bad one, it's extremely hard to master it, every framework does not look like JavaScript but like another new language in itself, as there's a myriad of ways to do the same thing.

So let's go over a couple of ways we can implement this data structure

1. Basic JavaScript object:

```javascript
const houses = {
  key1: 'First House',
  key2: 'Second House',
  key3: 'Third House',
  key4: 'Fourth House',
  key5: 'Fifth House',
};
```

2\. JavaSciript map structure introduced in ES6

```javascript
const houses = new Map([
  ["key1", "First House"],
  ["key2", "Second House"],
  ["key3", "Third House"],
  ["key4", "Fourth House"],
  ["key5", "Fifth House"],
]);


houses.get("key1"); // First House
```

This one has some advantage of additional methods like get, set, and delete so it gives yo a better mental model of the actual Hashmap.

3\. And lastly the TypeScript implementation

```typescript
type HouseKeys = 'key1' | 'key2' | 'key3' | 'key4' | 'key5';

const houses: Record<HouseKeys, string> = {
  key1: 'First House',
  key2: 'Second House',
  key3: 'Third House',
  key4: 'Fourth House',
  key5: 'Fifth House',
};
```

This task is achieved via Record type, providing as with a good typing support.

### Summary

This article got a bit complicated till its end. Haha, I warned you! JavaScript is actually very complicated and messy under its core, but actually, you don't need to know all of that.

Just remember the core idea of ðŸ”‘ key and value pair, and you'll be golden.

### Fun story

I actually remember a story when I first encountered this pattern for the very first time.

It was a web application where I was handed over to finish a piece of functionality by a much more experienced developer than me. Where we basically had an app layout with 5 states. For every state, we loaded a unique component, so the code looked like this in React \`{components\[state]}\`

At this moment it was too advanced code for me, so for a couple of days I was refactoring things here and there trying to understand what's going on and come up with a simpler solution. At the end of the week, I have removed the senior developer's code, and basically reimplemented the exact same thing by the end of the week, as there wasn't anything better for this particular task.

Damn, if only I knew this data structure I would have saved some time, but I only by reinventing a wheel I was able to learn the concept by hand.
