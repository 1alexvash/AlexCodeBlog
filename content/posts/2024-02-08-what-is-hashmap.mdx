Hashmap is a famous data structure.

Joma Tech, for example, loves using it in his videos for jokes, this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bId3N7QZec) is my favorite one.

There might have been some confusion, as in developing circles you might have heard this term quite often while not knowing exactly what it is. That's true as Hashmap is actually a data structure from Python. The closest we've got in JavaScript is an object. But, if you are looking to level up your knowledge, it's good to understand the terminology as you're going to better understand the whole data structures concept.
