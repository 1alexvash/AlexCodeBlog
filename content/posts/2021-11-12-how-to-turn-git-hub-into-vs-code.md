There's this new feature by GitHub that lets you use Visual Studio Code editor inside your repository.

To turn it on, just click **.** on your keyboard

Or you can just change a domain name from

github.**com** to =&gt; github.**dev**

![](http://localhost/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/github-shortcut-4.gif)The only restriction of this environment is that it doesn't let you run terminal, so it is suitable only for code searching.

Good enough for me, at least I won't have to clone the repo to find some line of code.
