Codewars if you don't know is a platform for studying, and practicing different algorithm challenges similar to LeetCode.

But what makes Codewars stand out to me is the gamification element, they have an interactive system of levels, so you are motivated to up your level, to tackle more difficult tasks. I mean it's a very cheap trick, but it makes it work, I was very engaged, and I was excited to come back again, and again.

## The benefits of the platform:

###1 Challenges are fun

The problems weren't too difficult, and too easy, they were just right, so I was excited to keep on studying everyday

###2 Problems are interesting while practicing on the platform I was exposes to variety concepts like converting RGB to Hex, working with dates, refreshing on Rome numbers.

For example, Josephus Problem[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josephus_problem] it's not something you are normally thinking in your daily life, but is quite fascinating to learn about.

###3 General intelligence

The problems you are going to encounter on the platform it's not exactly the kind of problems you're going to face at your work, or even in real life, but they are pretty good at making your ü•§ juices flowing, by exposing your üß† brain to different new concepts, and this will, in fact, help you recognize semi-related problems in real life, and solve them ‚ö° quicker, and more efficiently.

###4 FAANG companies need it

There's not really much to say on this one, if you're ever planning to land a job at one of those companies, practicing algorithm is a must.

But even if you don't, it's still going to give you some üìà boost, for other jobs.

###5 Better code

The most important of them all, after you solve a specific Kata, the system gives you solutions of other people to this same challenge, so you can compare yourself to others, analyze other approaches, and apply them next time to solve the problem more effectively

I really think, it's the best part of this platform, as by only doing this, I have learned many JS construct or features I didn't really know about which are quite useful for your day job.

Just looking at cleaner neater code or different approaches to the same problem makes you ü§î rethink some of your approaches which is a üóù key for continuous growth.

### Tip

Try to mock the solution, to the problem with Quokka, without Copilot though, otherwise it's going to be easy üòÇ

## The bottom line

Codewars can definitely give you some edge, or a good marginal improvement, but it does not guarantee anything in itself, especially if you don't put it in the work.
