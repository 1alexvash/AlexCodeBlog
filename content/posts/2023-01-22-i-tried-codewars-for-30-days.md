Codewars if you don't know is a platform for studying, and practicing different algorithm challenges similar to LeetCode.

But what makes Codewars stand out to me is the gamification element, they have an interactive system of different levels, so you are motivated to level up, to tackle more difficult tasks. I mean it's a very cheap trick, but it does make it work, I was very engaged, and I was excited to come back again, and again.

## The benefits of the platform:

### #1 Challenges are fun

The problems weren't too difficult, and too easy, they were just right, so I was excited to keep on studying everyday. 👨‍🎓

### #2 Interesting problems

While practicing on the platform I was exposed to variety concepts like: converting color format from RGB to Hex, working with dates, converting Roman numbers to Arabic, and etc.

For example, [Josephus Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josephus_problem) it's not something you are normally thinking in your day do day life. But, it did give me a couple of funny flashbacks from my childhood, when I was playing with my friends in something similar.

Oh boy, it's such a pity I didn't know about this concept before! 😅

### #3 General intelligence

The problems you are going to encounter on the platform it's not exactly the kind of problems you're going to face at your work, or even in real life, but they are pretty good at making your 🥤 juices flowing, by exposing your 🧠 brain to different new concepts, and this will in fact, help you to recognize semi-related problems in real life, and solve them ⚡ quicker, and more efficiently.

> Chocolate bar problem for example, was a very interesting one. When I had to figure out how many breaks it takes to break the chocolate bar into 1x1 pieces.

### #4 FAANG companies need it

There's not really much to say on this one, if you're ever planning to land a job at one of those companies, practicing algorithm is a must.

But even if you don't, it's still going to give you some 📈 boost, for other jobs.

### #5 Better code

The most ♥ loved benefit by me is the ability to see other people's solutions after you solve specific kata.

The platform gives you solutions of other people who solved this kata, so you can compare yourself to other, analyze other approaches, and apply them next time to solve next problem more effeciently.

I really think, it's the **best** part of this platform, as only by doing this, I have learned many JS constructs or features I didn't really know existed. Which are now useful in my day to day work.

Just looking at cleaner neater code or different approaches to the same problem makes you 🤔 rethink some of your approaches which is a 🗝 key for continuous growth.

### Tip:

Try to mock the solution, to the problem with Quokka, as its instant feedback feature will help you break down the problem, and it's going to save you time on context switching, and clicking the submit button.

> Obviously, don't use GitHub Copilot alongside like in the example above, as otherwise, it's going to be a child's play. 😂

## The bottom line:

Codewars can definitely give you some edge, but only if you're willing to put in some work, and practice.
