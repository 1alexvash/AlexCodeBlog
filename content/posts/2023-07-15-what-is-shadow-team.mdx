A Shadow team is a business model when one person talks to the client and takes the project while the second person does the actual job.

This model is very popular on freelancing platforms like Upwork. Let's find out why.

Let's say you own an IT agency in India, and you're about to negotiate a big contract.

But your client actually wants to talk to the person who will be in charge of the project.

So, whom you're going to send for the business meeting.

Rohit is a great programmer. He is capable of solving difficult problems, and he's a highly regarded member of your team, but when it comes to soft skills, you know that Rohit is only good at talking to computers, so it will be a failure from the get go.

Ankit, on the other hand, is not great at coding, when Rohit performs code reviews on Ankit, he actually thinks that Ankit should've been fired a long time ago. But besides that, Ankit has a great English and is also very likable, so with his minimal knowledge of tech skills he's still capable of explaining to the client the whole development process. Besides, the client does not know much about the tech anyways; hence this is why he's looking for a professional.

So, the choice is a no-brainer. The first goal is to persuade a client into working for you, and only the second goal is to create an actual business solution.

This model might look a little odd, and even unethical from a certain point of view, as one person does the whole chunk of work, while the second takes the whole credit for it.

Meanwhile, the client might not even be aware of the existence of another person.

So, all of it is very interesting, but I promise this is more complex than it is, and this is what I'm going to discover in the second part of this article.
