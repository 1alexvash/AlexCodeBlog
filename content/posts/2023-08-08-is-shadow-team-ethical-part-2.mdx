First thing first, fuck ethics, ethics are subjective. People who talk a lot about ethics, are usually the ones who lack it most.

If you are not sure what I'm talking about, definitely check the [first part](https://alex-code.com/post/2023-07-15-what-is-shadow-team) of this article.

I think the shadow team is a great example of the natural flow of evolution.

> "It is not the strongest of the species that survives, nor the most intelligent that survives. It is the one that is most adaptable to change." - Charles Darwin

The reason why this practiced emerged in the first place is very simple. First of all, we've got to remember that the Upwork is an extremely competitive platform.

A single decent project can receive 100 applications. So, to stand out, you need every single advantage you can possibly get.

And the shadow team model is one of them, as it is hard to combine `hard` and `soft` skills in a single person.\
\
@ It's like mutualism in the nature when two species interact with other for mutual benefit.

In the final part of this article I will address whether this model is bad or good for everybody, and I promise you will be surprised.
