First thing first, fuck ethics, ethics are subjective. People who talk a lot about ethics, are usually the ones who lack it most.

If you are not sure what I'm talking about, definitely check the [first part](https://alex-code.com/post/2023-07-15-what-is-shadow-team) of this article.

I think the shadow team is a great example of the natural flow of evolution.

> "It is not the strongest of the species that survives, nor the most intelligent that survives. It is the one that is most adaptable to change." - Charles Darwin

The reason why this practice emerged in the first place is very simple.

We got to remember that the Upwork is an extremely competitive platform.

A single decent project can receive 100 job applications. So, to stand out, you need every single advantage you can possibly get.

And the shadow team model is one of them, as it is hard to combine `hard` and `soft` skills in a single person.

It's like this example of cooperation that occurs in the nature where different species interact with each other for mutual benefit.

And that's a simple reason why this business model appeared on Upwork.\


In the final part of this article I will address whether this model is bad or good for everyone, and I promise it will surprise you.
