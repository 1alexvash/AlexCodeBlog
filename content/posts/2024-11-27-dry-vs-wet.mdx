In this article, I'm going to share a short entertaining and educational story I heard which will teach you about two software design principles.

First one, `DRY` which stands for - Do Not Repeat Yourself, and the second `WET` which stands for Write Everything Twice.

It might be tempting to discuss and debate those principles endlessly without really realizing the problem underneath them, and it is to solve the problem, and do not get yourself in trouble.

So the story goes like this:

A younger software engineer (who has got 5 years of experience) recently got a new job at new company and this person has got a 🎓 mentor who is a software engineer with 10 years of experience.

And this younger engineer is given his first task.

The mentor says, "You've got to develop a new web page `B` which resembles the template of the page `A` what are you going to do?"

The young engineer says, *"Oh, I know. Clean code is important, duplication of code is bad, I know patterns are an important thing, so we're going to use DRY principle here, and we're going to create a parent factory, and refactor all the components, so the page `A` and `B` will use the same components, but just with the different properties".*

The senior engineer answers, *"Wrong! It might look like a clever idea, but this is what going to get you in the problem further down the line. Right now, in development it might look like those both pages use the same components, so it's good to refactor, and to reuse parent components for both of them, but just with different properties, but the problem is that in 2 - 3 sprint iterations those two pages aren't going to look nothing alike, so you are just going to overspend time refactoring and overcomplicating simple components which will try to manage all the possible complex cases in the world.*

So the right answer is, *"Just copy and paste! `Ctrl + C`, `Ctrl + V`!",*

It's really an unexpected story and the plot twist, when I heard this story for the first time I didn't even consider the second option as an option. I just was thinking in terms of the first younger stubborn programmer who needs to refactor everything, in order to make the "code clean".

> Sometimes the wrong way is the right way

And this is what's the business sometimes really needs and requires and even for a 🧑‍💻 developer like yourself it just a faster and more efficient way to do things sometimes, so that's the wrap of a valuable lesson I learned.
