There are many productivity techniques out there, pomodoro is probably one of the most famous and prominent one.

### Why do we need productivity techniques in the first place?

All engineers, especially successful ones, have some routines and structure allowing them to get into the zone, and maximize their productivity. For somebody, it might be a comfy chair, allowing this person to tap into a work mode, seemingly not a major thing, but without it this person can't work long hours and produce his best work output.

You find those tips and tricks only with time, and with trials and errors.

Think of them like in game weapons, depending on a specific type and style of problem, a specific kind of weapon might be more efficient, like for ü©∏ killing a üê≤ dragon, you would likely want to choose a bow.

Thus, for example, another famous technique "Eat the üê∏ frog" is mostly effective for somebody who's constantly procrastinates, and can't focus on the main thing, so this technique might allow this person to feel the most significant life difference.

### Who is the perfect candidate for the Pomodoro Technique?

This time management technique might be very well suited for somebody who has many equal priorities, but struggling to keep up with all them.

It's really perfect for somebody who has a variety of interests in life, but due to lack of proper time blocking having trouble keeping up with all of them, and making the necessary progress.

Let's see it how works.

### How does it work?

The principle behind it is super simple, maybe that's the reason why this technique is so easy to remember and use and thus so popular. Basically, you schedule your work in üçÖ 25 minute chunks, each following a 5-minute rest, after 4 chunks like this, you take a longer break.

During every chunk, you specifically work on [one specific thing](https://alex-code.com/post/2024-02-15-one-thing) distraction free, while being focused on nothing else. Meanwhile, during your rest break, you can do whatever you want: use social media, go for a walk, chat with friends, read memes, basically anything you want, allowing you to properly rest for the next chunk of work.

### Cognitive restoration

Let's talk about the üí† cornerstone of this technique, the rest.

It might not be so obvious, but this is the key to success.

Let me tell you a personal story, so you don't fuck up like me.

When I started studying programming, I was young, and for some reason I had this stupid attitude for my studying, basically thinking I am going to attack programming for hours, without any breaks in between until it eventually clicks, and so no need to say that I failed miserably, and ended up mentally burned out, feeling like, "tech might be not for me".

Which is especially sad, considering that back then programming was harder, and I didn't have a smart GPT model saying to me, "dummy, take a rest".

This is somewhat similar to ü•ä fighters taking a one-minute rest between rounds, so they are ready to attack their opponent refreshed with full of energy. Without it, they will gas out immediately and just lose the fight.

Once again, this is not so obvious, but our üß† brain needs a similar break, to refill its üîã battery, and be able to ‚öî attack the task at hand with its full power and ‚ö° energy.

### Limits

It is believed that an average person can't handle more than 10‚Äì12 üçÖ tomatoes or (5 - 6 hours of actual work) during an average day.

You might argue that this number is less than a typical 8-hour work day, so this does not sound like typical 60 hours a week hustle grind culture from the popular media, but if tomato technique is done properly, you'll be surprised to do 2X of productivity during a single hour of work compared to somebody who's hanging out in the office all week, and just talk to colleagues or drinks coffee all day long.

### The bottom line

I highly recommend, giving this technique a try, as this one stuck with me for years, and I have not yet found anything better.

I'm currently experimenting and having great success with doing üçÖüçÖ two chunks of work at the time, basically doing a 50-minute work session with a 10-minute rest in between, as it suits me better, and I heard of some scientific research of this technique discovering that this timeframe actually aligns better with the brain wave cycles.

But, I guess it's more about personal experimentation. Give it a go, and let me know how it goes.
