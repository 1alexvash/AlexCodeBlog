### Why do we need productivity techniques?

All engeeniers, especially succesful ones, have some routines and structure allowing them to get into the zone, and maximaze their productivity. For somebody it might be a comfy chair, allowing this person to tap into a work mode, seemingly not a major thing, but without it this person can't work long hours and produce his best work output.

You find those tips and tricks only with time, and with trials and errors.

Think of them like in game weapons, depending on a specific type and style of problem, a specific kind of problem might be more efficient, like for ü©∏ killing a üê≤ dragon, it makes sense to give an archer's bow a go.

Thus, for example, another famous technique "Eat the frog" is mostly effective for somebody who's constantly procrastinates, and can't focus on the main thing, potentially allowing this person to feel the most significant difference out of applying this technique.

### Who is the perfect candidate for the Pomodoro Technique?

This time management technique might be very well suited for somebody who has many equal priorities, but struggling to keep up with all them.

It's really perfect for somebody who has a variety of interests in life, but due to lack of proper time blocking having trouble keeping up with all of them, and making the necessary progress.

Let's see it how works.
