- You save time writing console log statements
- Every console log statement has a name attached to it, so you won't get lost trying to find the right one (It will save you even more time, as we are all about developing productivity here)

**Pro tip:** The default keyboard shortcut is slightly cumbersome as you have to press so many buttons at once, so I have written my own one, which is more convenient =&gt;
