To start off, let's firstly understand what imperative mood is in the first place.

## What is it?

So, there are two types of moods, indicative, and imperative.

Indicative mood is used when reporting facts, for example:

* Fixed bug
* Removed file
* Changed page structure

It is something, we typically use in speech.

On the other hand, the imperative mood it is not something we're typically use in speech, because it is more of a commanding tone, like you're giving instructions to somebody, same example with imperative mood:

* Fix bug
* Remove file
* Change page structure

## Reasons to use imperative mood

So now you know the difference, I would like to go over the reasons why you might switch to the imperative one, even though it might feel awkward at first.

### #1 Git limit size

Git has a limit of 72 characters for git title line, while VS Code goes, as far as to suggest keeping it under 50.

So using the imperative mood is going to save you a couple of characters of space. Not bad!

Once again, this mood might feel unusual at first, but after some time your brain is going to start to interpret it as the fact of the past, so you are not going to see a difference, so I'd prefer to user shorter mood to be more expressive.

### #2 Eloquence

This one goes with the previous one, I don't know how to explain it exactly, but when you start thinking in this way, your commit messages are actually end up being twice as short from the way they were before.

I mean in this way of thinking it kind of activates my üß† prefrontal cortex to keep the main information in the title, and keep the rest of the information inside the body of the commit message, where I can use the past tense to go in the details of my work.

It is something I just wasn't inclined to do before.

### #3 Consistency

Another benefit of this style is that it creates a feeling of congruence, so it feels like your code was written by a smart human being, not a üêí monkey robot.

### #4 Enjoyable git history

When you mind your commits, your code starts to feel like it is a üìö book with chapters in it.

So, it gets easier for you and others to navigate in it, and find some important information in it.

### #5 Git team

I am not a cool üë®‚Äçüéì smart man, but the people behind git definitely are, and they are using [this style](https://github.com/git/git/commits/master), so, it is something to take into account.
