There is a **good** and there is a **bad** news for you. Let's start from the bad one.

### Bad news

Let's look at a typical skill levels depending on your job rank:

Middle is stronger than Junior dev, and Senior is stronger than Middle dev accordingly.

And you know what ChatGPT is great at? Getting the basic stuff done like writing a small function or an  API call.

If you can't get beyond that, then you are screwed. As Senior and Middle level devs suddenly got access to the personal Junior level assistant who is there 24/7.

Companies just won't hire somebody to do basic stuff like that as there's an AI for that now.

### Good news

On the other side, you are as a junior dev suddenly got access to üìö senior level knowledge. So, üë®‚Äçüéì you're going to learn faster as well.

ChatGPT is much better and efficient than Google when it comes to searching information, as I already said in this [article](https://alex-code.com/post/2023-04-22-why-chatgpt-is-better-than-google), so it gives you a competitive edge among other developers who weren't smart to research this tool as mentioned in this [article](https://alex-code.com/post/2023-04-30-should-you-be-afraid-of-chatgpt).

### The bottom line

Initial entrance skills level to get a job got higher, but you might as well be able to get those üî® skills quicker.

So, it is up to everybody who'll put it in the work.
