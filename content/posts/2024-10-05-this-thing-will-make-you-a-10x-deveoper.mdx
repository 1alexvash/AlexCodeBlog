Let's play a game. Tale a look at the picture, and try to find the difference.

![](</post-images/This thing will make you a 10X engineer ILLUSTRATION.png>)

I went out on the street and asked 20 people, and surprisingly nobody could point out the real difference, but interestingly enough more people told that the right set of pictures looks better/more attractive, even without being able to clearly articulate why the morphed pictures on the right side look better.

Here's the data, by the way:

Shockingly, I heard all sorts of ideas in this pool about what makes those pictures different, but nobody, nobody got it right! It was so fun, as people had all sorts of explanations: it's lighting, skin, eyes, nose, age, camera, and etc. But no one noticed that the real difference was in the neck size for those males! And people, were relived and laughed when they heard the real answer, we had a ton of fun, even though the first approach was intimidating, but after that it felt like this poll was the most fun I ever had, by the way the reason I do this experiments can be found in this [article](https://alex-code.com/post/2024-11-15-confidence-experiment-asking-100-strangers-on-the-street) - I think it might be the best article I have ever written, definitely worth checking it out.

In short, those experiments provide a cool way to challenge myself and engage with people socially, like in this experiment I even went out and asked a girl I had a crush at the time to participate in the experiment, but also it is super fun to do this experiments as not only you have fun, growing yourself socially, but you are also collecting interesting data, and in this experiment I did found out that people generally prefer males with a thick neck. This is more prevalent among females, and more adult people. I did not track it specifically, but like the youngest people in my poll usually gave reversed answers, and said they like the left set of pictures, I think you can clearly guess why.

### Takeaway

This article has a broader message with interesting implications rather than just a simple fun experiment, so going back to the title of this article in life there might be things that people are unconsciously judging us upon and make conclusions about us as human beings, personality and our worth, even without taking a full account on why the do that. Like in this street test that I underwent with people, some people were staring at those pictures for 1â€“2 minutes, but still could not point the real difference, but they already made their judgment about which set of pictures looks better.

This is a bit unfortunate, but you can turn things around in your favor, if you study the world and get curious about it, you might discover pretty wild stuff, like for this article I picked the neck morph images specifically due to new recent information I found saying that thicker neck is associated with maturity, leadership and confidence, and the reason why it is associated with those things if you think about it, it is due to the fact that it usually more mature older people who have a thicker neck, and also a thicker neck gives you a massive advantage in let's say wrestling as the opponent can't that easily grab your neck, or if you get punched, a thicker neck is going to minimize damage by providing extra stability, so that's why in this article I found and proved a strong tendency of females to prefer those males on the right side.
