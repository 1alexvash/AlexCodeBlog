Okay, this is going to be a very unusual article of mine, but at the same time it might be the most valuable article I have ever written.

I have done this unusual experiment where I went up on the street and asked 100 strangers a simple and a super quick question about what their favorite eye color just to collect the data.

The first reason I wanted to conduct this experiment is because I was interested in results, but the real reason is that wanted to try out this hypothesis of approaching dozens of people in order to overcome my fear of approaching people, and to lower my neurotic and anxious thoughts on a daily basis, and the best part... It worked!
