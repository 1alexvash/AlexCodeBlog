Okay, this is going to be a very unusual article of mine, but at the same time it might be the most valuable article I have ever written.

I have done this unusual experiment where I went up on the street and asked 100 strangers a simple and a super quick question about what their favorite eye color just to collect the data.

The first reason I wanted to conduct this experiment is because I was interested in results, but the real reason is that wanted to try out this hypothesis of approaching dozens of people in order to overcome my fear of approaching people, and to lower my neurotic and anxious thoughts on a daily basis, and the best part... It worked!

It was kind of an arbitrary idea, but I kind of liked the idea of collecting data like they often do for different polls on the news and articles on the web, so I really wanted to get in the shoes of this data üßë‚Äçüî¨ sciency person and also try approaching so many people in a single day.

I have this belief that many people fail in life, it's not necessarily due to the fact that they are not smart, but because they just aren't courageous enough in order to reach to as many people as it needs to reach their goals, and they just give up way too easily, so observing any improvement in this area if any after the challenge would have a ripple compounding effect for the rest of my life.

It was just an experiment inside an experiment, and for me, it was a great deal, so I just could not say no.

### Data collected

Let's firstly check on the collected data, and then I'll tell you what collecting this data has taught me.

So blue eyes are the winners no surprises are here, followed by brown and closely by green eyes, and also a couple of my people educated me on the presence of gray eyes, so that was a fun experience.

### Lessons learned

Let's go to the actual lessons learned during the actual data collection/approaching people, I guess the big one is that you're going to improve as you go, the idea of first approach no matter how simple it was, it was just freaking me out as I had no idea what the fuck I was doing.

And it really showed on my actual results. Out of the first 10 people I approached, 50% of them rejected me, even though I had a simple question that can be answered in 2 seconds. By the last 10 or 20 approaches of the experiment, I think nobody has rejected me, so that's a massive improvement here and there.

Well, you could ask, how did I get such a massive difference?

Well, there are multiple components, at first, I didn't really have the clue what I was doing, how to approach and stop people, what words to use, how to reason and convince them to stop, but throughout the experiment which in total took me 6 hours of the day I learned how to use the right amount of voice volume, voice tonality, eye contact, and how to signal my approach with a wave of a hand, and it drastically made the experiment easier as I went on this day by improving throughout the challenge, by approaching 150 people by the end of the day.

I did happen to go overboard a bit, as I went on with the experiment, as I decided to restart the experiment by collecting a bit of extra data about the participants in order to make the experiment a bit more sophisticated. So after the restart I decided to take a notebook with a pen in order to collect the data, instead of my phone, which as a nice trick increased my presence and credibility massively in order to get people to answer to me, and I started collecting the data after every answer like their gender + rough age tier (young / adult / senior).

So this chart shows that females have higher prevalence towards liking brown eyes than males, but otherwise nothing much interesting.

Also, I did this cool thing on whether participant owner answer matched with their own eyes, and here's the data collected:

* 64% of people with blue eyes like blue eyes too
* 57% of people with brown eyes like brown eyes too
* 28% of people with green eyes like green eyes too
* 0% of people with gray eyes like gray eyes too (\* data sample is extremely small, statistical mistake here is sky-high, and the data here does not tell much story anyways)
