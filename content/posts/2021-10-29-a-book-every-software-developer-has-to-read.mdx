There are some Java books that are good for Java developers, there are some C++ book that are good for C++ developers, and so on.

But there's one single book.

A really special one â€“ real deal. By reading which, you'll benefit, no matter what language you use for writing code.

[Clean code](https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship-ebook-dp-B001GSTOAM/dp/B001GSTOAM/ref=mt_other?_encoding=UTF8&me=&qid=) by Robert Martin.

This book will be a turning point in your software development career.

I can literally tell the code before, and after I read it.

The book dives deep into topics small topics like naming variables.

One cute example from the book is for different programming statements to use different parts of speech.\
Like for **functions**, use **verbs** like: go / withdraw / stop.

And for **conditions** **adjectives** or questions that can be answered with **yes or no** like: isReady, showMenu, isPremium, and etc.

The book dives in so many different nuances, and examples you were not aware of. It amuses you how it was possible to write such a bad code. (Well at least with me)

If you ever encounter the situation when you opened your cold code, and couldn't figure what the hell is going on. Then grab this book. It'll help you out to clean the mess.

**PS**

The only things I didn't like about this book:

1\) Examples are only in Java, so it might be harder to get it

(I think you can skip examples part, and read only theory, and still benefit tremendously)

2\) Those same Java examples didn't have any good formatting not syntax highlighting, so it almost to impossible to read them. At least in my Kindle edition.

(A little bit ironic in the book about clean and readable code, don't you think so?)
