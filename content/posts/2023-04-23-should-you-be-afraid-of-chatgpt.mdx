No, you shouldn't be afraid of ChatGPT.

Actually, you should be happy about new technology, embrace it and max out its full potential.

I know seeing this tool is very intimidating, as so far we haven't seen anything capable of generating human - like language smart enough to pass [the Turing Test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test).

It even scarier seeing this tool generating code, no wonder you start wondering whether this tool will replace your programming job any time soon.

But it actually isn't as bad as it seems. What I've found in my personal experience it isn't as good for generating code as it looks. For a couple of reasons:

Firstly, at my work I work on a somewhat big of a TypeScript enterprise application and in there we have layers on top of layers of different libraries and packages, so to write any code in there you need to be aware of all of those context intricacies just make anything work, and in this case, ChatGPT isn't much of a use. Though on the other hand, GitHub Copilot does an amazing job on a more local level, so AI still helps there.

Secondly, chat is hallucinating sometimes when it thinks it gets some piece of code right when it is actually not, so you have to dive into the prompting rabbit hole to extract needed information. Not perfect, but still sometimes nicer than the Stack Overflow rabbit hole.

Thirdly, there's a Chat's training cut-off date. Which is not ideal for JavaScript devs, for example, as often times you have to work with cutting-edge stuff, so the framework released in 2021 might be ancient in the JS world by today. Thus, it is just something to keep in mind as It might not know what's the latest buzz or throw some old code at you.

I mean it's not perfect for coding yet, but it is for searching for general complex queries.

To me, it feels more like a [replacement for Google](https://alex-code.com/post/2023-04-22-why-chatgpt-is-better-than-google) rather than for programmers.

### So, what should I do about it?

Take advantage of it, obviously!

Our lives will be more and more intertwined with AI as the time goes on.

This is one thing for sure we can be confident in.

@you should be looking for everything that gives you an edge (regarding Copilot thought, this is what scary)
