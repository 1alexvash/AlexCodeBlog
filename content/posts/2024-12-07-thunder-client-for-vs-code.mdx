Recently, I found an interesting tool, and at first I could not believe that such magical thing can be implemented inside VS Code.

But here it was, an entire mini Postman client implemented and planted inside the editor via the [Thunder Client](https://docs.thunderclient.com/) extension.

Let me show you a quick presentation of how it works:

### Demo

### Bottom line

Basically this extension can do everything the Postman client can do, but inside a neat VS Code environment, so you don't even have to leave your favorite code editor which makes it extremely convenient especially when it comes to doing small bits like testing server connection, verifying whether an API endpoints URL returns any data, or just coping JSON data from the server.

But, I must say, this extension has one limitation it does not sync collection data between different devices, so when it comes to bigger projects this is not a serious replacement of Postman.

Otherwise, that's it for today, it was a short tip from me today, if you know anything cool please email me, and I'll be glad to check it out.
