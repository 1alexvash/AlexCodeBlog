David Goggins is a spiritual role model of mine, and seeing his comeback with the second book is a beautiful thing to witness.

Especially, considering that the second book is better than the first one, the legend did it again.

How rare is that? Do you know many movies like Top Gun, for example, where's the second part is better than the first one? I don't  have that many examples to name to be honest.

The first book introduced us to the story of David Goggins, about all of the challenges and trials of racism, growing up in a bad neighborhood and with a fucked up family, but still succeeding despite those incredible odds.

So from the second book I was expecting to hear more stories, like from the first book incentivizing people to do almost an autistic style of self-improvement by almost killing themselves by working harder until eventually they might succeed or what not, but this is not how it went, and it's for good, as it means the David has grown up, his attitudes changes and he becomes a better person.

@what the book was all about? btw

@second book is better , it's rare, like top gun

@interesting to see other facets of his personality, not doing the same thing

@extreme hard work is great equalizer

@a good example a good role model

@autistic style of self improvment, he changed
