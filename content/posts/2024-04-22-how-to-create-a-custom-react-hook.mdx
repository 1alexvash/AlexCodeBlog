@any premise?

React custom hooks are much, much easier from what you think they are. In a nutshell, they are just simple functions, and it's a very good mental model to keep in mind while working with them.

Let's get into an example

### Example

We are going to build a simple counter app. It will serve three functions:

1. Display the current state
2. Has an increment button
3. Has a decrement button

First, of all, let's define the custom function and export it:

```typescript
const useCustomCounter = () => {
  
};

export default useCustomCounter;

```

Now let's define a state

```typescript
import { useState } from "react";

const useCustomCounter = () => {
  const [count] = useState(0);

  return { count };
};

export default useCustomCounter;

```

And, now let's add `increment` and `decrement` functions, so we can actually play with it.

The complete code for the hook:

```javascript
// hooks/useCustomCounter
import { useState } from "react";

const useCustomCounter = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  const increment = () => setCount((count) => count + 1);
  const decrement = () => setCount((count) => count - 1);

  return { count, increment, decrement };
};

export default useCustomCounter;

```

Now, to make it work, we'll have to => hook this into our app.

```typescript
import useCustomCounter from "./hooks/useCustomCounter";

const App = () => {
  const customCounter = useCustomCounter();
  const secondCustomCounter = useCustomCounter();

  return (
    <div>
    <div>
    <h1>First counter < /h1>
      < p > { customCounter.count } < /p>
      < button onClick = { customCounter.increment } > Increment < /button>
        < button onClick = { customCounter.decrement } > Decrement < /button>
          < /div>

          < div >
          <h1>Second counter < /h1>
            < p > { secondCustomCounter.count } < /p>
            < button onClick = { secondCustomCounter.increment } > Increment < /button>
              < button onClick = { secondCustomCounter.decrement } > Decrement < /button>
                < /div>
                < /div>
  );
};

export default App;

```
