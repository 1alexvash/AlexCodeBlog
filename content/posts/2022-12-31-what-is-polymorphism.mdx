I was asked this question, so many times during job interviews that I decided to write an entire article about it.

Even though the word sounds scary, the entire concept behind it is very simple.

Let's start off with the example, as a picture is worth a thousand of words.

### Example #1

> A car is a car\
> A track is car\
> They are both cars, but they are not entirely the same.

What's common about them? They both take you from point A to point B; hence they are cars, but driving a track makes you money, while driving a car is an expense hence polymorphism.

### Example #2

Let's say we have some social network or web forum, and on that platform we apparently have some users, they both can create posts, create comments, chat, and etc.

Their interface can look something like this:

```typescript
// Regular user
const user1 = { name: "Jane Doe", age: 25 };
```

```typescript
// Admin user
const user2 = { name: "John Doe", age: 25, admin: true };
```

The only admin difference between those types of users is that admin can remove content created by other people.

### Example #3

I think by now you should be starting to grasp the concept, but let's get into a more nuanced example, where you might not initially spot the case for polymorphism pattern.

Do you see it?

Those are all phones with chat messages, but the on the right has an image attached to it.

It might not seem like a big deal, especially if you haven't worked with back-end, but in reality you might have to deploy an extra dedicated server, just to store those images alone, and supports this feature.

## Why should I care?

There are a few reasons:

1. It's going to give you a couple of extra points on job interviews
2. It will increase your knowledge about architecture,
   [or also known as high-level thinking](https://i.imgur.com/hunkkp4.png)
3. By better planning in advance, you can save a lot of time and work faster
4. Not only this knowledge is important for general intelligence, but it's also required for senion level jobs
