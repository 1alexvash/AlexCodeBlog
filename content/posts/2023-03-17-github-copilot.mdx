I've been using GitHub Copilot for over a year. Here's my product review.

To cut to the chase, I noticed from 10% to 20% boost in terms of coding speed.

So, I'm basically able to fit my 8-hour workday with 6â€“7 hours if I were to work without Copilot.

I'm lazy as fuck, so I can't, I just can't afford to go back to the old inefficient ways of the past ðŸ˜œ

It took me some time to figure out how to use it, but I will save your time, and share some examples. 

## Examples

### Mocking data

### Answer for Stack Overflow kind of questions / Creating function / Navigating new waters

### Context recognition

### TypeScript

It is also good at navigating new waters when you work with new technologies, and don't know how exactly they work, for this demo  Copilot helps me create a new TS type, and fix a generic TS any type.
