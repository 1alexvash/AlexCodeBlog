I've been using GitHub Copilot for over a year. Here's my product review.

To cut to the chase, I noticed from 10% to 20% boost in terms of coding speed.

So, I'm basically able to fit my 8-hour workday with 6â€“7 hours if I were to work without Copilot.

I'm lazy as fuck, so I can't, I just can't afford to go back to the old inefficient ways of the past ðŸ˜œ

## Cases for using Copilot

### Mocking data

### Answer for Stack Overflow kind of questions / Creating function / Navigating new waters

### Context recognition

Though it did not start off as well, the first couple of days I was very really skeptical about this whole Artificial Intelligence thing, as it was giving different suggestions which were mostly out of place, and irrelevant to the task at hand.

It honestly took me a good couple of days to understand why those recommendations pop, when they pop, and how to interpret them.

After a month of my free trial, with one extra free to go, I already decided, I'm going to pay for it, as I do value my time, and generally have the desire to write code faster.\
(Slightly change phrasing)

But, let's review specific cases for the tool, because if you don't know how to use the tool, it's going to be like playing stradivaly? guitar? Without no knowledge of music, you just won't be able to do a single thing.

## Examples

// Stackoverflow question
