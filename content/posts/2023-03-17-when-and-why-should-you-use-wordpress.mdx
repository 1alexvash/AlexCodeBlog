In the previous article I was revealing my coding insecurities by hating on WordPress.

In this one, I'm actually going to tell you why it actually might be a good solution for your platform at hand.

## No bad tools

(only ...bad worker or some other quote?)

(nailing a nail with a screwdriver?)

So first thing first we need to understand that there are no bad tools, there's a specific tool for every instrument and every problem.

If you're building some complex platform with dozens of custom tailored components with unique functionality, then a WordPress is a terrible solution for you.

But if you need to build some simple web page, which was built a thousand of times before you, then WordPress is a perfect fit for you.

This is what I actually did for some of my clients. I knew they wanted something simple for their business, just to test the waters, you know. So, I recommended WP as a technical solution, and what I actually did I hired an external freelancer to build a website for them. As it is an extremely popular and most importantly, very cheap freelance solution, as those people mastered the art of copy and paste, so they can create entire WordPress website in a matter of a couple of days.

And those clients were quite happy with the result. The end product ended up costing close to nothing, the development time was sooner than they expected, and it was just overall a stable working solution.

Plus, WordPress has a ton of YouTube resources, so I don't need to educate my clients on how to use the system editor or bill them for consultation time, I just can send them a couple nice intro videos. Which is going to save my client even more time.

## Bottom line:

So yeah, you might not like the WP because it is not the cutting-edge technology, but we need to remember that there's a tool for every job and for some of them there's simply no alternative to WordPress.
