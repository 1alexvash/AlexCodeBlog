This concept is very often asked during job interviews, since it is usually one of the simplest rules of thumb to distinguish a beginner developer from an intermediate to advanced developer.

It is very commonly that:

* Beginner didn't work with async code, yet
* Intermediate developer worked with this concept a little bit
* Advanced one, worked with async code a lot, and knows plenty of edge cases

And a typical big enterprise web application does not live in isolation, it is quite the opposite of it, it has to communicate with dozens of other services like payment providers, authentication logic, different microservices  or third-party services, and etc.

And if something goes wrong there, the mistake will be costly, so nothing shall go wrong!

### Concept in a nutshell

Everything is actually very simple, synchronous means happening one after another, basically sequentially, asynchronous happening at the same time.

Think of a relay race, you have one runner passing a baton to the next runner until the end of the race. While asynchronous race it just a typical Olympic race, where all runners start all together, and we don't know who's going to finish first, and who will finish last.

### Practical applications

When you work on an app locally without connecting it to the internet, and create your classes and call your functions, this is typically synchronous sequential code, but when your app goes and wild on the internet itself, it usually starts interacting with other web services via API calls over HTTP.

Who could have guessed that initiating classes and calling functions is faster than API calls over HTTP
