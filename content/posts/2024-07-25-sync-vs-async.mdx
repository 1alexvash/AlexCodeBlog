This concept is very often asked during job interviews, since it is usually one of the simplest rules of thumb to distinguish a beginner developer from an intermediate to advanced developer.

It is very commonly that:

* Beginner didn't work with async code, yet
* Intermediate developer worked a couple of times with it
* Advanced one, worked with async code a lot, and knows plenty of edge cases

As a typical big enterprise web application does not live in isolation, and actually, it is quite the opposite of it, it has to communicate with dozens of other services like payment providers, authentication logic, different microservices  or third-party services, and etc.

And if something goes wrong there, the mistake will be costly, so nothing shall go wrong!

### Concept in a nutshell

Everything is actually very simple, synchronous means happening at the same time, asynchronous means occurring not together at the same time moment.

To think of a better example, think of a race, when we have a race, people are running together AKA synchronously, but when we have a relay race, a special kind of race, people run one after another!
