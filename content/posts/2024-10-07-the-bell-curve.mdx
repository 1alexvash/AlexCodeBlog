This book left me with mixed feelings. First of all, why is it one thousand pages long? The book was very easy to read, but without the repetitiveness, it could have been easily condensed to one hundred pages.

Otherwise, the book makes a great case about the advantages of cognitive elite (high IQ people), and I'm confident it is important for you to know them, so nobody gets advantage of you.
