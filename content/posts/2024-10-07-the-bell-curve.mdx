This book left me with mixed feelings. First of all, why is it one thousand pages long? The book was very easy to read, but without the repetitiveness, it could have been easily condensed to one hundred pages.

Otherwise, the book makes a great case about the advantages of cognitive elite (high IQ people), and I'm confident it is important for you to know them, so nobody gets advantage of you.

### Education advantage

This is not a surprise that intelligent people do better in school/university, as this is what intelligence is all about, studying and doing it really good.

There are no surprises in here, like there's no surprise that athletic kids are doing better on the field than non-athletic kids, but the next advantage is more interesting.

### Economical advantage

Authors claim that high intelligence is a better predictor of social outcomes than being born in a rich family.

As they cite that 95th percentile of IQ was better off by the age of 40 financially then the 95th percentile of wealth.

> Why is it that smart people are at the top of dominance hierarchies and the answer to that in part is because they get there first. Everything's a race roughly speaking and the faster you are the more likely you are to be at the forefront of the pack. And intelligence in large part is speed.\
> Â© Jordan Peterson

### Criminal advantage

Another advantage of high IQ people "enjoy" is that they don't get to prison unnecessarily, basically, as their intelligence allows them to make good money without any incentive to commit any crime.

Then the authors make another argument that  actually low intelligence and inability to adapt to a complex society is what incentives criminals to commit crime in the first place, and that's why there's a higher proportion of lower intelligence people in prisons.

Very interesting argument, and chapter in this book.

### Marriage advantage

This one, once again, a bit unexpected, with an interesting twist, that's why this book is interesting to read, as it offers some different perspective, but basically what authors say in this chapter is that highly intelligent people get married later and divorce way less frequently.

We do not know exactly what's the high IQ score has to do with it, but one possible explanation is that smarter people are better at picking, and filtering their partner as they have a better sense for a 'marriage material' also they are smart enough to prevent future conflicts by negotiation, and when they are in conflict they find it easier to resolve it to prevent future upcoming problems.

### Red tape advantage

We're living in an extremely complex societies, and some of the red tape we had to deal with by the authors of this book is done unnecessarily, so the government can sort of punish poor people for not knowing the rules in this complex society.

Thus, a limited amount of super smart people who can navigate around those bureaucratic procedures get to enjoy benefits like: tax returns, getting different grants, discounts and etc.

Something to think about when you'll be dealing with some boring documents next time, just treat it as an intelligence test.

### Affirmative action

Another interesting subject touched upon in this book in order to counterbalance the advantage of smart people is affirmative action.

It's basically this good, positive idea of lowering the requirements for some minorities based off their skin color, but as the authors claim this is likely to backfire in an unexpected way, as even though those minorities get easier entrance to university they just usually unable to keep with the material and studies, so their drop rate is way higher.

So by trying to help them, the government actually hurts them by creating unrealistic expectation of what's studying is like.

### Distribution of intelligence

An extra interesting topic touched upon in this book is the variability of intelligence, do we really differ in intelligence? Well, kind of yeah,  there's a distribution in height for example, so why there's no difference in intelligence?

So then you are referred to a super cool appendix in this book where's the statistics and terms like standard deviations are explained, and you can feel super smart about knowing all of that.

### Malleability of intelligence

Another harsh take from authors is that you can't change your intelligence, and there's virtually nothing you can't do about it.

As the research on intelligence intervention hasn't gone so far.

I don't really like the conclusion from this book, as it can give the reader a limited mindset, without actually equipping them with any solution on how to better in life.

I mean, somebody can have all the intelligence in the world, but if this person is just lazy and does not do anything with this gift, then this person still won't likely to succeed in life without hard work.

Also, intelligence is not the only variable predicting the success in life, even though the authors of this book want to make it look so, but there are some other parameters in your control like your personality, like for example, if you are naturally very extroverted then you are likely to do good in sales, where you'll be encountering many human interactions, so there's an extra edge you have which it just stupid for you not to use!

### The bottom line

This was a very old book, and not a typical read of mine, but I still enjoyed it, as in this book I learned and explored the idea of intelligence what it is and how does it impact ours lives.

If you can persist through the long size of this book, then it is something I'd recommend for you to read, as the ideas from this book are definitely entertaining and are something that can equip you better for life.
