I've been using GitHub Copilot for over a year. Here's my product review.

To cut to the chase, I noticed from 10% to 20% boost in terms of coding speed.

So, I'm basically able to fit my 8-hour workday with 6â€“7 hours if I were to work without Copilot.

I'm lazy as fuck, so I just can't afford to go back to the old inefficient ways of the past ðŸ˜œ

It took me some time to figure out how to use it, but I will save your time, and share some examples.

## Examples

### Mocking data

When it comes to working with repetitive data, Copilot is a beast.

### Prompting

I honestly prefer Copilot to ChatGPT as I don't have to leave my IDE to solve the problem at hand.

### Context recognition

On top of the previous example, Copilot is great at solving problems with some existent context.

### TypeScript

It is also good at navigating new waters when you work with new technologies, and don't know how exactly they work, for this demo  Copilot helps me create a new TS type, and fix a generic TS 'any' type.

## Bottom line

Hate it or love, but AI programming is here to stay, and currently GitHub Copilot is the easiest way to get ahead of your peers, so it would be dumb to ignore this tool.
