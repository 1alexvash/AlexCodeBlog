Let's start from the backstory. When my first internship at my first tech job was over, my salary doubled overnight as we negotiated only half pay during the internship with my employer.

Do you know what kind of thoughts I had this day? Hell, if my time worth double of that it used to, does it mean I can work twice less, but work for the same pay?

Of course, I could not because in software companies you are expected to work long hours, so those companies can max out the potential of every single ðŸ§  brain cell you have. However, I did succeed at negotiating a 4-day week. I mean, I'm not going to lie it was not that easy. It took me some back and forth, but eventually, after a couple of meetings with my manager, boss, and HR, I explained my point, got the approval, and created the first precedent of this work schedule inside the company.

### What about money?

This schedule requires a 20% pay cut, and surprisingly, all of my colleagues thought I must be nuts to undergo such a decrease. I mean it was odd to as well, as they did not value the value of their free time. I mean, what's the point of making all this income if you don't have any fun?

To be honest, 20% doesn't really make a difference to your lifestyle. Even when I was on my internship, I was fine financially as I used to be a minimalist and not to spend money on stupid stuff.
