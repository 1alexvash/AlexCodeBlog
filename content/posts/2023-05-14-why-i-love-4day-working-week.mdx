Backstory: After my first internship at my first tech job ended, my salary doubled overnight since I was only receiving half pay during the internship.

And do you know what kind of thoughts I had this day? Hell, if my time worth just doubled, does it mean I can work twice as less?

Of course, I could not because in software companies you are expected to work long hours, so those companies can max out the potential of every single ðŸ§  brain cell you have.

However, I did succeed at negotiating a 4-day week. I mean, I'm not going to lie it was not that easy. It took me some back and forth, but eventually, after a couple of meetings with my manager, boss, and HR, I explained my point, got the approval, and created the first precedent of this work schedule inside the company.

### What about money?

This schedule requires a 20% pay cut, and surprisingly, all of my colleagues thought I must be ðŸ™ˆ bananas to undergo such a cut. But it was also odd to me, I was curious why people did not value their free time?

To be honest, a 20% cut is not that of a big deal to your lifestyle, as you are already working in tech and probably making above-average wage.

So in my case, as I'm a minimalist and don't buy stupid stuff I don't need, I didn't have to starve or limit myself with anything by switching to a 4-day workweek schedule. I was even fine financially during my internship when I was making even less.

I mean, what's the point of making all this big tech money if you don't have time to spend it?

### What are some perks of this schedule?

**Travel** â€“ So the big problem with the traditional Monday to Friday schedule is that it leaves you with 2 days off, but the problem is, whenever you want to organize any kind of getaway you're likely to spend one day on the road, so it actually leaves you with a single day of travelling.

And you know what is even worse? Getting back from this mini trip spending the rest of my free time on the road not being able to properly recovery for the upcoming working week. Such a drag!

One extra day off when working a 4-day workweek was a game changer for my mini trips. To properly visit the place, you were interested in, and get back to work feeling refreshed.

**Leisure** â€“ The opportunity for extra time to read many books and hit more gym workouts was simple amazing to me!

**Study** - With the given freedom, I'm more excited about studying tech outside my workings hours, as I'm not so exhausted at my day work, as my colleagues were.

And the final nail in the coffin, ðŸ¤¯ paradoxically with this schedule, I did end up studying and working with more frameworks / libraries / project technologies than my colleagues who clocked more hours, but were dead tired of coding on weekends. So in the end, during further technical evaluations at my company, I received higher scores of my competence, and ended up with higher raises than my peers, so while I was working a 4-day workweek I was making the same as they were working a 5-day traditional work week.

ðŸ˜… A little bit ironic, right?
