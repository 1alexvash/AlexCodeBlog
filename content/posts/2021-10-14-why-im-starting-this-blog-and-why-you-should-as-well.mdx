The idea to start a blog in 2021 doesn't seem legit. Yeah, I get it.

I was thinking, exactly, the same until I read "The Complete Software Developer's Career Guide by John Sonmez".

In the [book](https://www.amazon.com/Complete-Software-Developers-Career-Guide-ebook/dp/B073X6GNJ1), he tackles a couple of arguments why it is still a solid idea, and in this article I'm going to list some benefits you can get out of blogging.

But you better grab that book, it's really that good.\
It's going to change your life, I promise.

### Why to blog?

The biggest benefit of blogging is that you will be able to ingrain the knowledge you have.

By writing about some particular topic, you'll be able to dissect what is important and what is not.

This process will help you to achieve true mastery and wisdom.

Not only will you improve understanding of certain technologies, but you'll learn to communicate better to other people.

Which is kind even more important because even though we are writing software.

Software is primarily made for humans, not robots.

By being able to communicate better to humans, you'll be able to get more out of those interactions. Also, write less useless code.

Just imagine how it would feel, when somebody asks you a question like do you know TypeScript, and you answer would be like, "Oh, yeah, I've written a couple of articles about it".

Having a blog is a good way to share the wisdom and knowledge you gain every day with others people.

And I encourage you to start one!
