In the previous article, I shared [a trick](https://alex-code.com/admin#/~/post/2022-01-02-vs-code-undo-last-git-commit) to undo a commit, but let's say we have already pushed this commit, so the commit is no longer local.

### Reasons to undo commit

Before we'll dive into the demo. Let's go over a couple of reasons when it might be smart to try to undo your commit.

* You pushed something really dumb
* You want to have a mini fix, for example for a typo
* You want to have a nice clear and easy to read git history
* You don't want to push another commit for a mini typo fix
* If this is a shared project then you are likely don't want other collaborators to notice you doing something dumb, and coming to the conclusion that you are dumb as well (Perhaps my favorite reason ðŸ™‚)

Alright, with the reasons, let's go over the demo to see how it actually can be done.
