The last year 2023 has been wild on AI products and AI adoption. Especially with GPT models coming into our daily lives.

But in this article, I would like to take a look at 10 AI models you might have been using for a while, not even realizing they were based on AI.

Just to get you a better understanding of those past models, our present and upcoming future with AI.

### Shazam

We have all been using Shazam to find our favorite tunes, but little did we know that not only this technology was based on AI to recognize and classify songs, but also it was first released more than two decades ago.

### Gmail spam filter

On a similar note, Gmail uses labels to categorize emails into buckets to sort incoming correspondence into spam and not spam boxes.

For example, an email with the text requiring urgently pay the invoice might sound fishy, but if this email is coming from an official PayPal email address that's a good indicator to label this one as not spam.

Ultimately, many factors have to be taken into an account by an algorithm before making a decision.

### Google Car

Another Google's product is self-driving cars. As you can see by this illustration, it once again uses AI models to classify objects before making any move to get you safely from point A to point B.

And as you have already noticed. AI models are all about classifying, that's a repeating theme throughout this article.

### Netflix movie suggestion algorithm

For big companies like Netflix, your engagement on the platform can be the difference between a profit and loss for this business month. So naturally, they want to get you hooked, so you spend your best time with them having lots of fun.

And the algorithm has to be sophisticated. They can't just simply offer you the best and highest-ranking content on the platform.

For two reasons. First, this content might run out meanwhile, leaving you bored with worse quality content. Second, this top ranking content might not have been your cup of tea in the first place to begin with.

So the platform goes really advance, and starts noticing your patterns among other users.

For example, Netflix might have noticed that you are really like John; you both liked the same two last movies you watched. And it notices that John just watched "Don't look up" and really liked it, so Netflix pushes it really hard in your feed, so you pay attention as it knows you might very well really like it.

### Snapchat filters

Those one broke the internet. You probably don't know a single girl who hasn't used them. Even though, it might have been a bit silly trend. Those filters showed precisely what is possible via augmented reality.

### FaceApp

The next step of evolution in face filters is FaceApp.

In contrast with Snapchat filters, the ones on FaceApp are a bit more advanced. As it is not only about funny masks on your head, but about filters that can change the color of your hair or show how will you look like once you are old.

Giving you food for thought regarding your style or maybe even diet choices.

### Remove.bg
