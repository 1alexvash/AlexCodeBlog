Voice messages are not something you will typically encounter with many clients, as it is something used more often for casual communication. But  as you still might, there's one easy way to make them 10X better to improve your communication game.

### The problem with voice messages

Actually, there are a couple of problems with them if unused properly, so some messengers like Telegram even have a premium feature to restrict selected people from sending voice messages to you.

Three main issues with voice messages:

\#1 Duration

Voice messages can last minutes, as it is very easy for the sender to click and record a 10-minute audio of gibberish, then to actually organize their thoughts in proper order.

\#2 Context

Voice messages are easy for the sender, but not for the receiver. When you receive one of those out of the blue, it is very hard to guess what this one might be about. Whether about this or that, whether you should listen now or later. One thing for sure, you definitely don't want to create such ambiguity for your communication partner.

\#3 Point

And the last issue with voice messages is that they might miss the entire point the sender was trying to articulate. If the voice message is 10 minutes long, it might take me days to allocate time to listen and respond to you, as I can't just quickly glance over it like a regular text to figure out my response right away.

But, luckily for you, there's a simple way to fix that.

### The right way to send voice messages

Voice messages are not entirely bad, as there's a time and place for them.

Some stuff is simply just too complex to be covered over text, and also there are some things that are impossible to properly convey without a right voice tone.

But you must do it in the right way, so here's the answer.

Just by attaching a brief description to your voice message you are automatically resolving 3 previously mentioned issues.

With the given context, you are making it very clear to your listener what this message is about, so it automatically becomes more convenient for them to listen to you and respond to you faster.

### The bottom line

The golden rule of communication:

> Make it easy for your partner to respond.

If you won't, don't wonder why it takes longer for them to respond to you and why they are not as open to your ideas as you would like them to be.
