This article will answer a broader question on whether it is worth paying a premium for better tech.

I got two windows laptops. Both are 15'6" in size and fall under the office category.

* First AsusXXXX purchased for $500 dollars
* Second Xiaomi OLED purchased for $1 500 dollars

There’s a three time price difference between them, and the question is whether it is worth paying more?

So let’s not waste any time and start comparing them

### Battery

The biggest noticeable difference between those laptops was a battery life. The pricier laptop lasts like 6 hours, and the budget one only 4 hours, which I would consider short, as I had to prematurely end some work sessions just to get some charging.

I mean even Xiaomi with 6 hours, does not really compare with the battery duration of the latest Apple Macs which last for 10 hours, but still 6 is generally better than 4 hours of battery life.

### Performance

This one a bit funny, at first, I did not notice just any difference in terms of speed, which is very amusing assuming the price tag, but then I noticed even a more surprising thing, it felt like the cheaper laptop was actually performing and launching apps slightly faster.

Once again, I did not run any benchmarks to verify my claim, as I believe benchmarks are only for marketers who want to sell you stuff, and they are not something to base your decision on.

However, it was still interesting to find that the price tag alone does not dictate performance.

### Keyboard

This one also, a tricky one.

The pricy laptop has a premium backlight feature, so you kind of look super cool in the dark room. But the cheaper laptop has this more of a mechanical keyboard, which is slightly more pleasant to the touch, though it comes with the cost of making slightly more noise per keystroke.

### Screen

* Xiaomi screen xxx-xxx almost 4K
* Asus screen 1920-xd Full HD

In this category, the Xiaomi laptop dominates over the Asus one with its OLED feature. Which basically allows you to work under the direct sunlight, so you can work in other places rather than your dark office room.

### Design

The pricier laptop has a couple of advantages in this category

* It is slimmer, and lighter, so it is more compact in your rucksack, for example
* It’s been built with metal, not cheap scratchy plastic

### Bottom line

At the end of the day, those laptops are still the same computers, and they do the same kind of work tasks. There’s no magic in the expensive laptop, and it won’t just do all the work for you.

But, personally for myself, I will stay on the pricier laptop, as it is my main work tool I use 7 days a week, so those nice touches like:

* OLED screen
* Keyboard backlight
* Fingerprint
* Nice to touch metal over plastic
* Compact size

Those things do add up to an overall feeling of comfort, which allows me to work longer hours to afford nicer tools like this one.

But if you are not like me, and your work does not revolve around a laptop all day, then it’s probably ain’t worth paying a premium for features you won’t use much anyway.
