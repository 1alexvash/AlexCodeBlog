I'm going to split this article into 2 parts, in the first part, I will lash out on the platform, in the second going to discuss the positive parts of WordPress, so at the end you will make your informed decision about the platform.

Without further ado, why WordPress sucks:

### Buggy editor

A couple of examples...

### Buggy platform

"create post", doesn't show up sometimes...

### Slow

It is due to the nature of PHP render, I mean 1 or 2 extra seconds of load won't kill your business, but it will decrease customer satisfaction. I just hope the value of your content / product worth extra wait.

### Heavy

Very heavy in size, if you want just work with content: by posting, editing, and removing, you're going to need to install dozens of plugins, just to make it work.

### Spam

Lots of spam WordPress plugins, it's super annoying to receive the spam from your own website, and then just to google on how to turn them off, and realize, there's no other way than installing another plugin, to shut those notifications off ðŸ¤¯

### Bloated boilerplate

Boilerplate is terrible, there are dozens of tabs in the admin panel you won't ever be going to need which are going to make a nightmare to find the one you need occasionally.

### Hard to enhance

The platform is hard to enhance, if you're ever going to need extra features beyond the set of classical blog features, then best of luck to you.

Bad structure. If you're coming with the front-end background / mindset, working with WordPress will be a nightmare for you. As to edit a file, you'll need to go to a special editor in the WP system, and edit those .php files. And let me tell you, this editor sucks, as it doesn't have nice editor features like autoformatting text.

(Should I keep it?)

### Developing experience is poor

Developing sucks, to set up a server, you need to install a fuckload of database configs, different kinds of server instructions, to develop locally you're going to need about to install about 5 different programs, pushing those changes is another nightmare, and it just doesn't worth the hustle.

### Security

The platform doesn't feel secure overall, after you receive dozens of spam messages on just published website. In this case, popularity actually hurts WordPress, as there's a plenty of hackers looking to hack, and blackmail your website, so you need to constantly watch out for news, for the latest plugin to fix some new vulnerability.

Didn't I mention but just to make sure your website is secure, you need to install a package of different security plugins? Can you imagine it? It just doesn't feel like the WordPress was very well-designed.
