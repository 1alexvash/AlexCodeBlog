In the previous [article](http://localhost/wordpress/blog/getting-started-with-firebase-cloud-functions/), we have created our first cloud function.

You probably have noticed something interesting.

We can call our function via CURL, but not via fetch on the client.

It is due to CORS policy.

Let's rewrite our code in the **functions/index.js** using official way from the firebase documentation.

To this:

```javascript
const functions = require("firebase-functions");

// Create and Deploy Your First Cloud Functions
// https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/write-firebase-functions

exports.helloWorld = functions.https.onRequest((request, response) => {
  response.set("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "*");

  if (request.method === "OPTIONS") {
    // Send response to OPTIONS requests
    response.set("Access-Control-Allow-Methods", "GET");
    response.set("Access-Control-Allow-Headers", "Content-Type");
    response.set("Access-Control-Max-Age", "3600");
    response.status(204).send("");
  } else {
    response.send("Hello from Firebase!");
  }
});
```

We've configured some HTTP headers, and now we can get the data on the client via fetch.

But first to apply the changes, let's redeploy cloud functions:

```bash
firebase deploy --only functions
```

Now let's run some fetch call in the console.log

```javascript
fetch("https://us-central1-fir-project-3359f.cloudfunctions.net/helloWorld")
  .then((response) => response.text())
  .then((data) => console.log(data));
```

And it works!

But don't you find it is a little bit redundant to write so much code?

Is there an easier way?

Actually, there is.

First, we need to install cors package in the functions folder

```bash
npm i cors
```

And then we need to import this package, and wrap our function with this package, so our code we'll look like this:

```javascript
const functions = require("firebase-functions");
const cors = require("cors")({ origin: true });

// Create and Deploy Your First Cloud Functions
// https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/write-firebase-functions

exports.helloWorld = functions.https.onRequest((request, response) => {
  cors(request, response, () => {
    response.send("Hello from Firebase!");
  });
});
```

Make sure to import cors package like this, via passing origin parameter.

Otherwise, your code won't work.

### Quick update:

I found a simpler way without importing cors package.

Just add this line:

```bash
response.set("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "*");
```

So, our final code looks like this:

```javascript
const functions = require("firebase-functions");

// Create and Deploy Your First Cloud Functions
// https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/write-firebase-functions

exports.helloWorld = functions.https.onRequest((request, response) => {
  response.set("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "*");
  response.send("Hello from Firebase!!!");
});
```
