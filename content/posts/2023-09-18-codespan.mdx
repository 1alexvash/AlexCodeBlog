Let's start the review of the extension from the story. John is a programmer at the company. Like every programmer, sometimes he has problems with his code and finding solutions.

When John was sending his code, his colleagues were confused and didn't like his style of code sharing. However, his colleagues suggested that John use [CodeSnap]()Â as a code sharing tool. Let's see the difference in code sharing before and now:

The difference is significant; highlighting of the code, a simple background, and smooth corners make the code more readable and give it a nice look.

CodeSnap streamlines the process, making it a breeze to showcase your code effectively, ensuring it not only looks better but also becomes more accessible for others to understand and collaborate on.
