It doesn't look great, right? I think, the better idea will be usingÂ [CodeSnap](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=adpyke.codesnap)Â VSCode extension.

That's much better ðŸ¤© Smooth corners and simple plain background give a much nicer look.I hope this extension will be useful for you like for me
