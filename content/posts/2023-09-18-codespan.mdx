Let's start review of the extension from the story. John is the programmer of the company. Like every programmer sometimes he has the problem with his code and solutions. 

When John was sending code his colleagues were confused and didn't like his style of code sharing. But colleagues suggested John to use [CodeSnap](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=adpyke.codesnap) like code sharing tool. Let's see the difference of code sharing before and now:

When the time comes to share your meticulously crafted code with colleagues, clients, or fellow developers, simply taking a screenshot or copy the text variant of your code falls short of delivering the professional impression you want to make, right?

```javascript
function toHumanReadableDate(ISODate: Date | string) {
  const date = new Date(ISODate);

  const dateTimeFormat = new Intl.DateTimeFormat("en-US", {
    timeZone: "UTC",
    year: "numeric",
    month: "long",
    day: "numeric",
  });

  return dateTimeFormat.format(date);
}

export default toHumanReadableDate;
```

I think, the better idea will be using¬†[CodeSnap](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=adpyke.codesnap)¬†VSCode extension. With CodeSnap, you can explore the code in a more interactive manner. You can follow references, view variable values, and understand the context of your code more effectively.
