When the time comes to share your code with someone else, taking a screenshot isn't always the best idea.

```javascript
function toHumanReadableDate(ISODate: Date | string) {
  const date = new Date(ISODate);

  const dateTimeFormat = new Intl.DateTimeFormat("en-US", {
    timeZone: "UTC",
    year: "numeric",
    month: "long",
    day: "numeric",
  });

  return dateTimeFormat.format(date);
}

export default toHumanReadableDate;
```

It doesn't look great, right? I think, the better idea will be usingÂ [CodeSnap](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=adpyke.codesnap)Â VSCode extension.

That's much better ðŸ¤© It offers a much more polished appearance with smooth corners and a clean, simple background.

I hope you find this extension as useful as I do!
