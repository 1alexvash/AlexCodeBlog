When the time comes to share your code with someone else, taking a screenshot isn't always the best idea.

It doesn't look great, right? I think, the better idea will be usingÂ [CodeSnap](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=adpyke.codesnap)Â VSCode extension.

That's much better ðŸ¤© It offers a much more polished appearance with smooth corners and a clean, simple background. 

I hope you find this extension as useful as I do!
