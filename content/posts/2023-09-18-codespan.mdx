When the time comes to share your meticulously crafted code with colleagues, clients, or fellow developers, simply taking a screenshot or copy the text variant of your code falls short of delivering the professional impression you want to make, right?

```javascript
function toHumanReadableDate(ISODate: Date | string) {
  const date = new Date(ISODate);

  const dateTimeFormat = new Intl.DateTimeFormat("en-US", {
    timeZone: "UTC",
    year: "numeric",
    month: "long",
    day: "numeric",
  });

  return dateTimeFormat.format(date);
}

export default toHumanReadableDate;
```

I think, the better idea will be using¬†[CodeSnap](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=adpyke.codesnap)¬†VSCode extension. With CodeSnap, you can explore the code in a more interactive manner. You can follow references, view variable values, and understand the context of your code more effectively.
