My GPT Plus subscription just finished (this is going to become relevant at the end of the article), and I would like to tell about my experience.

This will be a short article, I will list out the benefits and tell whether a premium version worth it.

### Benefits

* Noticeably faster responses
* Always available even during high demand

(Though I never had a case with the free version being not available)

* Better at math âž—

(GPT 4, which comes as an addition with GPT Plus version, is much better at solving math problems compared to GPT 3.5 which tends to hallucinate and get it wrong quite often even with simple ones like calculating time between dates)

* Somewhat higher quality of responses

(I can't really describe the feeling, but GPT 4.0 feels more credible overall than GPT of version 3.5)

### Is it worth it?

No, otherwise I would have not canceled it ðŸ˜‰ as to me, it still mostly feels like the same thing.
