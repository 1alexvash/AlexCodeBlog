Last year GitHub Copilot, changed the way we write code forever, and it is not an overexaggeration, not a slight bit.

Personally, I have noticed about 10% boost in my speed, or sometimes even 20% on the good day.\
(Phrase it better)

Of course, it's well under 50% promise of the GitHub team, but it still a major change in my productivity.

(image illustration, me before Copilot 8 hours of work, me after copilot 6 - 7 hours of work)

I just can't afford to go back to the old ways ðŸ˜œ

Though it did not start off as well, the first couple of days I was very really skeptical about this whole Artificial Intelligence thing, as it was giving different suggestions which were mostly out of place, and irrelevant to the task at hand.

It honestly took me a good couple of days to understand why those recommendations pop, when they pop, and how to interpret them.

After a month of my free trial, with one extra free to go, I already decided, I'm going to pay for it, as I do value my time, and generally have the desire to write code faster.\
(Slightly change phrasing)

Even at my work I did notice my estimates got better. I actually started hitting closer to the targeted estimation time, as we usually tend to be overoptimistic with this kind of stuff. Which is also a positive change.

But, let's review specific cases for the tool, because if you don't know how to use the tool, it's going to be like playing stradivaly? guitar? Without no knowledge of music, you just won't be able to do a single thing.

// dumb colleagues ?

## Examples

Cases for copilot:

// Mocking,

or continuing the mock as well

// Stackoverflow question

context recorgnition?

// Navigating unkonws, typescript waters
