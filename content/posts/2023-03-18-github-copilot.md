Last year GitHub Copilit, changed the way we write code forever, and it is not overexaguration, not even a bit.

Personally, I have noticed about 10% boost in my speed, or sometimes even 20% on the good day.

Of course, it's well under 50% promise of GitHub team, but still a major change in my productivity.

I just can't afford to go back to old ways ðŸ˜œ

Though it did not start off as well, first couple of days I was very really skeptical about this whole Artical Inteligence thing, as it was giving different suggestion which were mostly out of place, and irrelavant to the task at hand.

It honestly took me a good couple of days to understand why those recoomendation pop, when the pop, and how to intrerupt them.

After a month of my free trial, with one extra free to go, I already decided, I'm going to pay for it, as I do value my time, and generally have the desire to write code faster.

Even at my work I did notice my estimates got better. I actually started hitting closer to the targeted estimation time, as we usually tend to be overoptimistic with this kind of stuff. Which is also a positive change.

But, let's review specific cases for the tool, because if you don't know how to use the tool, it's going to be like playing stradivaly? guitar? without no knowledge of music, you just won't be able to do a single thing.

// dumb colleagues

Cases for copilot:

// Mocking,

or continuing the mock as well

// Stackoverflow question

context recorgnition?

// Navigating unkonws, typescript waters
