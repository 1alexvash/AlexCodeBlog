GPT stands for Generative Pre-trainingÂ Transformer

In simple speak it means it is an artificial network capable of generating its own **content**.

### Artificial Intelligence example:

One fun example of similar AI is:

[This person does not exist](https://this-person-does-not-exist.com/en)

This AI network generates a realistic face of the person who does not really exist.

### Artificial Intelligence history

There was a lot of hype since the release of ChatGPT, but in fact AI is not entirely a new thing, it's been around for decades, but it gained popularity only recently.

### Why did ChatGPT become popular?

The reason is pretty simple. It is smart.

It can do a lot of stuff like:

- Answer your questions
- Find information for difficult questions
- Engage in small talk
- Generate text or create stories
- Offer recommendations
- Translate languages
- Summarize text
- And even write code!

People didn't experience anything like that before.

This network is not only capable of generating human like language, but also understands the whole context of the entire conversation.

So, this network provided us with a human - like conversational experience.

Something we've never seen from computers before even closely

No wonder it went viral.
