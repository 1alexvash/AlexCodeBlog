I think one thing ChatGPT did very well is exploited Google's weakness.

Google search results just got way worse in a last couple of years.

Which is kind of funny coming from the most coveted company in the world, which has  the best talents in this world, and can literally fire thousands of them [in a single day](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-64346921).

But still despite all its power, Google results were getting worse and worse.

It was taking more and more time to find information or answer to the question you were looking for.

## But why?

The Google search engine is used by billions, so ranking well in it can make or break your business.

No wonder SEO analysts wanted to hack it, and they succeeded at it.

***

Have you ever tried finding a üéÅ present for a family member in Google?

If you did, then you know that most of those results are üöÆ trashy:

* Some articles are pure garbage written by bots, but still rank high in search results for some reason
* Some miss important context, like you were looking for a present for mom, but the article suggests presents for parents
* The article page is not usable or does not answer your question

So even when you do end up on a decently looking page, you still have to sort through lots of advertised stuff in this article to find a good present.

I mean if there's an incentive to bring shitty articles to the top of search results, there's another incentive to advertise crap in those top-search articles.

It just a üå™ cycle of life, you know.

So, after all of this, it is no wonder a superior algorithm took off over the world. 

Let's hope for ü§û good.
