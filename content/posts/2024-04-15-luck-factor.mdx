The book starts off from an interesting asusumption. It asks us, on whether we can control our own luck, as we do at least know that there are lucky and unlucky people in life.

For somebody, something good is always happens while for the other person they have a bad streak of luck all the time.

So the author goes on scientific quest to discover whether we can control our own luck, and that's not a small deal, just imagine if you were able to increase your own luck just by 10 percent. It would definitely increase the quality of your life, and it would make it hella of more exciting life to live, and there's something to be said about that.

Let's dive into some of the core ideas of this book, but first of all, let's start with the premise, and ask ourselves on whether we can control our own luck, and that's what the author intends to do in his initial study. It starts a little bit "woo woo" and even crazy, but it all will make sense at the end.

So for the initial experiment they gather three groups of people: those who identify themselves as lucky, those who don't, and those who are somewhere in the middle
