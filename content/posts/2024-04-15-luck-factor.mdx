The book starts off with an interesting assumption. It asks us, on whether we can control our own luck, as we do at least know that there are lucky and unlucky people in life.

For somebody, something good always happens while for the other person they have a bad streak of luck all the time.

So the author goes on a scientific quest to discover whether we can control our own luck, and that's not a small deal, just imagine if you were able to increase your own luck just by 10 percent. It would definitely increase the quality of your life, and it would make it hella of a more exciting life to live, and there's something to be said about that.

Let's dive into some of the core ideas of this book, but first of all, let's start with the premise, and ask ourselves on whether we can control our own luck, and that's what the author intends to do in his initial study. It starts a little bit "woo woo" and even crazy, but it all will make sense at the end.

So for the initial experiment they gather three groups of people: those who identify themselves as lucky, those who don't, and those who are somewhere in the middle, and they make them play the lottery with a 50% percent chance to win a small cash reward.

And what do you think? Do you think that lucky people performed better in this lottery? If so, you are dead wrong, so was I, but in reality the chance to win the lottery was 50% for everybody. Science bitch.

You might think this was a stupid laboratory test to begin with, as what would you expect from a proper scientific test like that? Anything else, probably not.

Right after that, the first initial experiment, the author starts digging deeper on the nature of luck because after all those 3 groups of people identified themselves differently on the "luck" trait, and they had a different perception of their own luck.

It can be confusing sometimes, as most of us would identify ourselves somewhere in the middle, you are either a little lucky, or a little bit unlucky if you do believe in the luck in the first place. However, it turns out that the most profound personality differences are found in the extremes.

In people who think of themselves as extremely lucky or unlucky, and this is where it gets crazy because for the outliers on this luck chart, crazy things happen.

Some legitimately win real lotteries (multiple times in a row), escape aircraft crashes, and find their perfect life spouses in the most unlikely circumstances while for the other part of people the opposite stuff happens they get into multiple car crashes, break arms and legs until they have the proper recovery time, and then are quickly hit by another misfortune, so they end up being scared to even leave their own house.

Nonetheless, it turns out that in fact, you do have a certain control over your luck and destiny. Just listen to this story:

> In 1979, Hollywood producer George Miller was looking for a battle-weary, scarred, tough man to play the lead in the movie Mad Max. The night before his audition, Mel Gibson, then an unknown Australian actor, was attacked on the street by three drunks.

And there are many more stories like this, I particularly like the story of the guy who got in the car crash, and then ended up marrying a nurse at the hospital.

> Lucky people also have an ability to turn their bad luck into good fortune.

You might say, "it all sounds good, but it's not clear how to actually apply any of this".

And luckily for you (non pun intended). The author has the answer.

As it turns out, your luck mostly comes down to your mindset, or attitude, you might say, and there are **four** actual **principles **you can apply on the daily basis to increase the amount of luck you experience in your life.

And this part I'm not going to spoil it for you, I will leave it for you to discover.
