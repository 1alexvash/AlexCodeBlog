Closure is one of those complex JavaScript concepts, but if you can get a grip of it, then basically it is going to make you unstoppable.

![](</post-images/JavaScript closure illustration.png>)

The thing about closure is that it is used kind of everywhere in every framework, but not that often, so when you encounter one it might get you by a little surprise in terms of the actual behavior behind the implementation.

In a nutshell, this is a really basic concept, it just a function returning another function, let's check out the example:

```javascript
const outer = (greeting) => {
  const inner = (name) => {
    return `${greeting}, ${name}!`;
  };

  return inner;
};

const greet = outer("Hello");
console.log(greet("John")); // Hello, John!

```

It gets really clear what's the closure is all about when you inspect in greet function:

```javascript
const greet = outer("Hello"); // λ ​​​​​at ​​​​​​​​greet
```

This is basically a function returning another, and that's all to it! A promise of some future potential! So basically watch out for that, so you'll be prepared against surprises in the behavior when coding.

### A bit more complex example

Let's check for the recursive example of closure before we wrap, that's a bit more complex example, but you'll get the picture of more advanced patterns that are possible with the following pattern.

```javascript
function chainingClosureFunction(...initialArgs) {
  const accumulator = (...args) => {
    if (args.length === 0) {
      // If called with no arguments, return the final computed result
      return initialArgs.join("");
    }
    // Otherwise, accumulate arguments and return a callable function
    return chainingClosureFunction(...initialArgs, ...args);
  };

  return accumulator;
}

const result = chainingClosureFunction("A")("B")("C")();
console.log(result); // ABC

```

That's it for the article.

Honestly, I am still getting a grip myself with this pattern, so hopefully in the next year, I'll be able to rewrite this article with better and more accurate examples, but if you have something to say, then just feel free to text me, and we will improve this article further ;)
