This is a little bit of a wild story, but a year ago I had to find a partner to code with me on the same team, and I decided to reinvent the classic technical interview approach.

So to see the problem with the traditional approach, we have to look at two common ways to assess candidate's competence:

\#1 Theory based knowledge

This one is for some reason got very popular nowadays. It's where an interviewer asks you lots of questions like: "Whatâ€™s the event loop in JS?", "What is Tailwind and have you worked with it?", "Why do we need TypeScript?", "In CSS, whatâ€™s the difference between fixed and static?" etc.

Then after one hour interview is over, usually what happens, but you don't see it, is that the interviewer assigns you points based on the amount of questions you have answered.

So if Mike has 20 points while Jake has only 13 points, they are hiring Mike.

This kind of interviews already shows the problem with this type of assessments, as if your whole value and competence is measured in points â€“Â then the ðŸŽ¯ goal for the next interview it is to get more points (Of course, only if you know what's going on behind the curtains ðŸ˜‰)

But, the problem of these kinds of assessments is that those questions get repetitive very fast â€“Â as the pool of potential questions is limited at the end of the day, so it creates an opportunity to ðŸŽ® game the system.
