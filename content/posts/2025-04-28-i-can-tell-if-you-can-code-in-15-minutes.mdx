This is a little bit of a wild story, but a year ago I had to find a partner to code with me on the same team, and I decided to reinvent the classic technical interview approach.

So to see the problem with the traditional approach, we have to look at two common ways to assess candidate's competence:

**#1 Theory based knowledge**

This one is for some reason got very popular nowadays. It's where an interviewer asks you lots of questions like: "What’s the event loop in JS?", "What is Tailwind and did you work with it?", "Why do we need TypeScript?", "In CSS, what’s the difference between `fixed` and `static`?" etc.

Then after one hour interview is over, usually what happens, but you don't see it, is that the interviewer assigns you points based on the amount of questions you have answered in their spreadsheet.

So if Mike has 20 points while Jake has only 13 points, they are hiring Mike.

This kind of interviews already shows the problem with this type of assessments, as if your whole value and competence is measured in points – then the 🎯 goal for the next interview it is to get more points (Of course, only if you know what's going on behind the curtains 😉)

But, the problem of these kinds of assessments is that those questions get repetitive very fast – as the pool of potential questions is limited at the end of the day, so it creates an opportunity to 🎮 game the system.

I remember one time in the agency I worked for, we hired a guy who on the paper answered all questions, but still could not do the job at all, it's like our company questions got leaked or something, but eventually we could not continue working with this guy, sorry, but you have to eventually be capable of opening the code editor and doing something in there.

**#2 Technical home assignments**

These ones tend to get a lot of hate from programmers, and I think it is undeserved to be honest, but that's the point for another article.

But in general, companies get a lot of backlash from the public. A common reaction is: “Four hours of free coding, and no free latte with a six-figure salary? Hell no, I’m not doing that.”

Even though many candidates they don't see that those two things are connected, still lots of them decide to skip tech tasks, and completion rates on them end up being very  tiny.

So companies are a bit of weary of giving them to candidates in the first place.

### Solution

Since previous two options were bad, I did come up with this cool approach which allowed me to assess top candidates just in ⌚️ minutes, not hours.

So my test task went like this:

> Hey, as discussed previously before this meeeting in this brief interview I would really love to see you in action, so can you do the following for me, can you try to create the 🐍 Snake game in 15 minutes? I would like really to see your thought process.

And then happened, what I didn't even expect a good half which is 50% of candidates struggled with basic bootstrapping of the project, it's like Vue or Next.js, or React, or maybe I should just use Vanilla.

Another majority of candidates just started from CSS which is a wrong turn, as CSS is not even a programming language, so it doesn't tell me about your actual 🔧 programming skills.

But surprisingly, the guy who 🏆 won my heart that day, didn’t even try to code. He didn’t have to. You might ask, “How?” Well, listen on — he just opened his notebook, and went through his thought process:

> Okay, that's a snake game, so we need 2 by 2 grid or matrix.\
> Next the snake needs to move, so we need a timer.\
> Next we have food, we need to think how are we going to store the food...

And, boom! - that candidate did in 60 seconds of what others would not be able to do in one hour - he showed his thought process, his ability to break down the task, see the big picture, and solve the problem at the end.

As let's be real, this task is sort of a tricky task, in 15 minutes you won't be able to complete that project – but this is not what even asked of you if you are paying the attention.

And also this is not a very common type of interview tasks, right? Creating a game, that's a bit abstract, right? - But that's exactly, why this task works so well, at your work you are likely to work for some abstract domain like fitness, medicine or maybe just finance you don't have to understand 100% of it, but that's not required and not asked for, what's asked for is being able and willing to pick up knowledge on the go.

And the Snake game is a perfect example of that, you are a web developer not a game developer, right? But at the same time you are exactly familiar with the way this child game works, its rules, its mechanics and the way it looks, so it is still relatable and familiar.

I don't need to ask you some LeetCode question or the knowledge of 2D matrices, the actual coding test will show it all!
