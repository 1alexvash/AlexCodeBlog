This is a little bit of a wild story, but a year ago I had to find a partner to code with me on the same team, and I decided to reinvent the classic technical interview approach.

So to see the problem with the traditional approach, we have to look at two common ways to assess candidate's competence:

**#1 Theory based knowledge**

This one is for some reason got very popular nowadays. It's where an interviewer asks you lots of questions like: "What’s the event loop in JS?", "What is Tailwind and have you worked with it?", "Why do we need TypeScript?", "In CSS, what’s the difference between fixed and static?" etc.

Then after one hour interview is over, usually what happens, but you don't see it, is that the interviewer assigns you points based on the amount of questions you have answered in their spreadsheet.

So if Mike has 20 points while Jake has only 13 points, they are hiring Mike.

This kind of interviews already shows the problem with this type of assessments, as if your whole value and competence is measured in points – then the 🎯 goal for the next interview it is to get more points (Of course, only if you know what's going on behind the curtains 😉)

But, the problem of these kinds of assessments is that those questions get repetitive very fast – as the pool of potential questions is limited at the end of the day, so it creates an opportunity to 🎮 game the system.

I remember one time in the agency I worked for, we hired a guy who on the paper answered all questions, but still could not do the job at all, it's like our company questions got leaked or something, but eventually we could not continue working with this guy, sorry, but you have to eventually be capable of opening the code editor and doing something in there.

**#2 Technical home assignments**

These ones tend to get a lot of hate from programmers, and I think it is undeserved to be honest, but that's the point for another article.

But in general, companies get a lot of backlash from the public. A common reaction is: “Four hours of free coding, and no free latte with a six-figure salary? Hell no, I’m not doing that.”

Even though many candidates they don't see that those two things are connected, still lots of them decides to skip tech tasks, and completion rates on them are really tiny.

So companies are a bit of weary of giving them to candidates.
