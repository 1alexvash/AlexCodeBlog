This article will answer a broader question on whether it is worth paying a premium for better tech.

I got two windows laptops. Both are 15'6" in screen size, and they both fall under the office category.

* First is an Asus laptop purchased for 500 dollars
* Second is Xiaomi OLED laptop purchased for 1 500 dollars

There’s a three time price difference between them, and the question is whether it is worth paying more?

So let’s not waste any time and start comparing them

### Battery

The biggest noticeable difference between those laptops was a battery life. The pricier laptop lasts for about 6 hours, and the budget one only 4 hours, which I would consider short, as I had to prematurely end some work sessions just to get some charging.

I mean even Xiaomi with 6 hours, does not really compare with the battery duration of latest Apple Macs which last for 10 hours, but still 6 is generally preferable than 4 hours of battery life.

### Performance

This one a bit funny, at first, I did not notice just any difference in terms of speed, which is very amusing assuming the price tag, but then I noticed even a more surprising thing, it felt like the cheaper laptop was actually performing and launching apps slightly faster.

Once again, I did not run any benchmark to verify my claim, as I believe benchmarks are only for marketers who want to sell you stuff, and they are not something to base your decision on.

However, it was still interesting to find that the price tag alone does not dictate performance.

### Keyboard

This one happened to be tricky.

The pricy laptop has a premium [backlight feature](https://i.imgur.com/MS61Ddr.png), so you kind of look super cool in the dark room. But the cheaper laptop has this more of a mechanical keyboard, which is slightly more pleasant to the touch, though it comes with the cost of making slightly more noise per keystroke.

So basically, you have to choose your own poison.

### Web camera

This will be the most surprising point in this article, Xiaomi put a very cheap and low-quality lens in their laptop, so while using the Asus laptop I actually felt a bit more "attractive" during worky meetings, due to its higher quality, if that's something you also care about, lol.

### Screen

* Xiaomi has a 3.5K OLED screen
* Asus has a regular Full-HD screen

In this category, the Xiaomi laptop dominates over the Asus one with its OLED feature. Which basically allows you to work under the direct ☀ sunlight, so you can work in other places rather than your dark office room. (If that's something you are into, as I know a couple of programmers who have the sun allergy)

### Design

The pricier laptop has a couple of advantages in this category

* It is slimmer, and lighter, so it is more compact in your rucksack, for example
* It is made of pleasant to the touch metal, instead of a cheap plastic
* You can unfold a premium laptop with [one finger](https://imgur.com/a/4vtEbDC), while a cheaper laptop did not pass this test at all.

### Bottom line

At the end of the day, those laptops are still the same computers. There’s no magic in the expensive laptop, and in the same fashion it won't magically do all the work for you.

But, personally for myself, I will stay on the pricier laptop, as it is my main work tool I use 7 days a week, so those nice touches like:

* OLED screen
* Keyboard backlight
* Fingerprint (it has it too, for extra security)
* Nice to the touch metal
* Compact size
* Better battery

Those things, they do add up to an overall feeling of comfort, which allows me to work longer hours to afford nicer tools.

But if you are not like me, and your work does not revolve around a laptop all day, then it’s probably ain’t worth paying a premium for features you won’t use much anyway.
