I have a controversial take:

> Typos in your text is as close as it can be to disrespecting.

Unless, of course, you are medically proven to be retarded, then I guess in your case it is forgivable.

But jokes aside, why would you send a HARD and complex letter when you can send an EASY-to-understand letter?

### For instance

Let's say you are working for customer support, and you receive two letters.

One clean letter from Michelle and another from John full of typos, possessing much higher cognitive load for your brain.

![](</post-images/Languagetool ILLUSTRATION.png>)

You read the first letter in 2 minutes, and respond to in 5 minutes - relatively quickly helping the customer.

While for the second letter it takes you 10 minutes only to understand the content of the message. Not only, you spend more time reading this email. We still aren't sure whether your reply email will help John, as we don't know exactly what he was trying to articulate in the first place.

And I truly believe the behavior like this is disrespectful, as some people are just wasting your time for their luck of ability to clearly communicate a request and desired intent.

No wonder why people who raise to the top of the social hierarchy are commonly ones who are the most articulate. (\* There's an entire book discussing this idea, it's called [The Elephant in the Brain](https://www.amazon.com/Elephant-Brain-Hidden-Motives-Everyday-ebook/dp/B077GZT9Q1/))

This is very [LanguageTool](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/grammar-checker-paraphras/oldceeleldhonbafppcapldpdifcinji) extension comes in, just install it, and it will start correcting your mistakes and give you suggestions and recommendations to improve your writing.

### LanguageTool vs Grammarly

You might have heard of a Ukrainian company called Grammarly, which is, I guess, more advertised and popular, but there are a few reasons to use LanguageTool over Grammarly

* LanguageTool supports grammar correction for languages beyond English

If you are unlucky, like me, to learn some foreign language at some point, there's extra help from LanguageTool to be better at that language

* LanguageTool catches at least 2X more mistakes
* And the last one, LanguageTool extension provides better explanation for made mistakes, so it's easier to internalize what went wrong while writing

I'm a bit of bias, as I like LanguageTool so much, I'm even paying for the premium version, which is something I definitely don't recommend, as the premium version has the very exact same set of features as a free version.

But as this blog is all about productivity and becoming a 10X engineer, I am willing to recommend any product or tool capable of making you 1% better.

### Summary

Of course, in this article I have made a bit too strong case for "purity of writing", but it is more complex than that. Good communication is more than just a text with no typos. There are many more elements to it than simply writing without typos, but it is really a foundation, like in hygiene, it all starts from washing your hands. This is a foundational layer, and then you build one brick upon another one.

There are, of course, exceptions to it. In non-professional life, we can be intentionally sloppy while texting to make something fun, or we're just playing dumb with our friends. So context really matters.

Therefore, if this is a professional context, let's be the best we can be, and I hope the [LanguageTool](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/grammar-checker-paraphras/oldceeleldhonbafppcapldpdifcinji) extension can bring your best.
