When I grabbed the sample of this book on Amazon.

I was amazed.

The book was shockingly interesting and exciting.

The explanations of different concept were crazy simple, storyline intriguing, and I was hooked to follow along.

I was making notes every single page, I highlighted every single word with my Kindle highlight marker, so I can read it over again a bit later.

When I was reading the sample, I felt like I was learning rapidly fast, because I've got some understanding of concepts nobody was able to articulate so clearly. And, oh boy, that's a pleasurable, satisfying feeling.

And then when the shit hit, the fan. The second I finished with the sample, the author decided to switch up his targeted reader. From a 5-year-old kid to software engineer graduate.

The fun and easy part was over.

The rest 90% of the book was dedicated to electrical circuit.

The book had over a hundred of these schemes, and it just wasn't that exciting to keep reading, so finished the book a bit of disappointed.

My score:

ðŸ”¥ **10 / 10** For the sample part

ðŸ‘Ž **5 / 10** For the rest of the book
