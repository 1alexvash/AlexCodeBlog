As you raise in your career, you will encounter more and more situations where's mentoring, leadership or management, if not required than at least expected from you. And this book has valuable lessons about it.

Heck, you might even start a successful business after reading it. I don't know you!

My main lesson from this book was that I don't delegate enough.

Check this quote out:

> We do the work ourselves because we think no one can do it as well as we do.\
> \
> We do the work, whic makes us the only ones capable of doing the work.

Isn't that true?

***

Are you scared to delegate something because the other person might not do it as well? Then the author suggests 80% rule if the other can do the task at 80% of your quality, then it's something you should delegate for sure.

Scared to delegate because you might have nothing valuable to do? This is actually a very wrong mindset. When you delegate your mundane tasks you are freeing your 🧠 brain to think of strategy, so you counterintuitively become more valuable to the business by working less, as your job as a business person is to 💭 think.

Are you scared of hiring people because you don't have resources? This is also wrong, as there's always somebody you can find on Fiverr who can start working for you even 5 - 10 hours a week by doing the job you're not good at, so you can dedicate even more time to thinking or just resting whatever you are in the mood today!

### Time mindset

> Productivity is about more to increase output\
> Efficiency is about doing less to increase output.

### Business owner mindset

> Whatever work you do, it cab be broken down into steps and delegated to someone else

> A business owner's job is to create jobs.\
> \
> Your role is to produce the opportunity for people who want a good job with a good company.\
> \
> If you are doing the work, you are not creating jobs; you are stealing them.

> For you to become your business designer, you can no longer ask "how" but "who"

> "The greatest sign for a 👩‍🏫 teacher is to realize the children are working as if the teacher does not exist." That's the greatest sign for a business owner, too

> It's one thing to hand off a menial task to someone else, but to hand oof something you take pride in being at, something you're known for, that's a whole other ball game.

### Share responsibility

Another big lesson for me was sharing responsibility and trusting people, which was preventing me from growing my team, and managing it efficiently.

What do I mean by that. 

## The bottom line

I recommend this book to every successful software developer who is looking to level up.
