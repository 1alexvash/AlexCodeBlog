As you raise in your career, you will encounter more and more situations where's mentoring, leadership or management, if not required than at least expected from you. And this book has valuable lessons about it.

Heck, you might even start a successful business after reading it. I don't know you!

My main lesson from this book was that I don't delegate enough.

Check this quote out:

> We do the work ourselves because we think no one can do it as well as we do.\
> \
> We do the work, which makes us the only ones capable of doing the work.

Isn't that true?

### Is that about you?

Are you scared to delegate something because the other person might not do it as well? If so, then the author suggests 80% rule for you if the other can do the task at 80% of your quality, then it's something you should delegate for sure.

Scared to delegate because you might have nothing valuable to do? This is actually a very wrong mindset. When you delegate your mundane tasks, you are freeing your 🧠 brain to think of strategy, so you counterintuitively become more valuable to the organization, as your main job is to 💭 think.

Are you scared of hiring people because you don't have resources? This is also wrong, as there's always somebody you can find on Fiverr who can start working for you even 5 - 10 hours a week by doing the job you're not good at, so you can dedicate even more time to thinking or just resting whatever you are in the mood for today!

### Time mindset

The book is so great that a dumbass like me doesn't really have to add anything to it, so I'm just going to share my favorite quotes from the book:

> Productivity is about more to increase output.\
> Efficiency is about doing less to increase output.

### Business owner mindset

> Whatever work you do, it cab be broken down into steps and delegated to someone else.

> A business owner's job is to create jobs.\
> \
> Your role is to produce the opportunity for people who want a good job with a good company.\
> \
> If you are doing the work, you are not creating jobs; you are stealing them.

> For you to become your business designer, you can no longer ask "how" but "who"

> "The greatest sign for a 👩‍🏫 teacher is to realize the children are working as if the teacher does not exist." That's the greatest sign for a business owner, too.

> It's one thing to hand off a menial task to someone else, but to hand oof something you take pride in being at, something you're known for, that's a whole other ball game.

It all comes down to the idea of whether you would like to make $50 an hour working or $5 an hour doing no work at all.

### Work mindset

> If you actively make the company better, maybe you are making yourselv more valuable.

> It may sound crazy that hard work is easier than hard thinking, but it is.

### Hiring mindset

> For example, near the end of the ad, require that an applicant respond with, "I'm pumped for this job" in the email subject line of their response. You will find that the vast majority of applicants won't do this, which means they did not read the ad and are not truly interested in the job, or they are spamming, or they aren't able to follow instructions (a critical ability)

### Share responsibility

This is my favorite life-changing quote from this book:

> As you give your workers tasks, especially the responsibility for making decisions, some may still keep coming back to you for your input — even if you have captured the system you want them to follow. From their perspective, it makes sense, because what if they make the "wrong" decision? They are concerned about being reprimanded by the boss (you), or worse, fired. They surely don't want to lose your trust. But if you make the decisions for them, they can do no wrong. If you give them an answer and it works, they are rewarted for following your instructions. If you give them an answer and it doesn't work, it's not their fault. Either outcome, as long as you make the decision, is safe for them. And bonus — they don't have to think!

## The bottom line

I recommend this book to every successful software developer who is looking to level up.
