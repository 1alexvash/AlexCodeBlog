The best month ever.

### Story background

A year ago, I started watching this blogger called Hamza, and he started talking about subjects, nobody ever before have ever spoken about, so I started quickly relate to him.

One of those subject he was stressing about was the hidden dangers of social media, YouTube included.

And I was very surprised to see the YouTube on this list, as I thought of it, as an ðŸŽ“ "Educational" platform, but I was dead wrong.

I'm not going to lie, there is some educational content over there like, for example, a former Harvard professor posting the whole university personality course and all the lectures on there for free, potentially saving you tens of thousands of dollars, but events like this are rare like a â˜ƒ snowball in hell.

Most of them time, YouTube is an entertainment platform where you go from binge-watch one video to another with ads in between.

It only provides an illusion of self-improvement, and that's a lie. You think you are watching this cool video about the life of ants, and you're getting smarter, but you forget that it has zero practical life utility.

And I don't want to be offensive, but even if you watch those videos about the life of ants, you are still ten times farther than the vast majority of people who watch garbage content like news or some gossip and drama.

### Cutting the plug

To be honest, that wasn't hard, firstly as the night was approaching I automatically turned to my phone, but hence the addictive app was deleted, and YouTube was blocked from my PC (more on that later). I just naturally shifted to other activities like reading, or talking with my parents.

And for the later part of the month I had a big trip, so honestly I wasn't even thinking about it; hence I was genuinely quite busy.
