The best month ever.

### Story background

A year ago, I started watching this blogger called Hamza, and he started talking about subjects, nobody ever before have ever spoken about, so I started quickly relate to him.

One of those subject he was stressing about was the hidden dangers of social media, YouTube included.

And I was very surprised to see the YouTube on this list, as I thought of it, as an ðŸŽ“ "Educational" platform, but I was dead wrong.

I'm not going to lie, there is some educational content over there like, for example, a former Harvard professor posting the whole university personality course and all the lectures on there for free, potentially saving you tens of thousands of dollars, but events like this are rare like a â˜ƒ snowball in hell.

Most of them time, YouTube is an entertainment platform where you go from binge-watch one video to another with ads in between.

It only provides an illusion of self-improvement, and that's a lie. You think you are watching this cool video about the life of ants, and you're getting smarter, but you forget that it has zero practical life utility.

And I don't want to be offensive, but even if you watch those videos about the life of ants, you are still ten times farther than the vast majority of people who watch garbage content like news or some gossip and drama.

### Cutting the plug

To be honest, that wasn't hard, firstly as the night was approaching I automatically turned to my phone, but hence the addictive app was deleted, and YouTube was blocked from my PC (more on that later). I just naturally shifted to other activities like reading, or talking with my parents.

And for the later part of the month I had a big trip, so honestly I wasn't even thinking about it; hence I was genuinely quite busy.

### More reasons to quit the YouTube

Let's have a quick rewind of the history of the YouTube algorithms, as it is an important matter.

`First stage`, views count era. At the very beginning of the YouTube, videos were ranked by the count, as developers followed an easy assumption that a video with 1M views is more valuable / interesting than let's say a similar video but with 1K views.

Though despite its simplicity, it was the most exploited algorithm by scammers, so YouTube quickly switched to the next stage.

`Second stage`, duration time or the golden era of YouTube, where devs followed the presumption that videos that are actually getting watched are the ones worth recommending, and it was the most beautiful ear with the best videos, creators and recommendations hands down for common users like us, but unfortunately, it's gone.

`Current third stage`, click rate or low attention span era, with the rise of TikTok, the majority of users just lost the capacity to concentrate, so YouTube started pushing the stakeholder's agenda to increase the app revenue by incentivizing shorts and clickbaity videos; hence the more users click the more ads they are going to see, and the more money YouTube stakeholders will make.

This step in history emphasizes the official demises of the content quality of videos on YouTube.

### Benefits of the challenge

I'm more bored, but that's actually a good thing, like really good.

Since, I am more bored, I talk / reach to people a lot more, so I make more friends, and have a deeper and more meaningful conversations.

I'm at the point in my life where I have such an abundance of friends, that I need to read something opposite of "How to Win Friends and Influence People" book by Dale Carnegie, as it this point, I really need less.

Also, the female attention is just through the roof, I went from being invisible to chatting with girls every other day.

A quick example, I'm at the ðŸ’ª gym, the familiar girl walks in a really nice dress, I'm the only guy who compliments her for taking an effort to pick this nice outfit, she blushes and we have a quick chat.

All the other guys are ignoring her just by staring at the ðŸ“± phone or looking at the floor.

But, I'm changed, it feels like I was reprogrammed it feels like my default brain network is healed now, since I'm bored I just naturally have more curiosity to talk to other people.

I mean, damn, they are curious creatures, just go and talk to them.

It feels like right now, I don't need to watch any stupid videos on social confidence or how to cold approach women during day game kind of BS. Hence, I am so fucking bored & curious that I basically don't have any fucking alternative, but just go and talk to people, as otherwise I'm going to pay the price of even bigger boredom, and honestly, it's not worth discovering. All social anxiety is gone just like that.

In terms of work, I stopped watching any videos of the sort "Learn technology X in brief 90 seconds", and started reading documentations more. It's harder, but there's some sort of fulfillment in doing the hard thing.
