When it comes time to introduce your code to someone else, but sometimes to do the screenshot isn't good idea.

It doesn't look great, right? I think, the better idea will be using [CodeSnap](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=adpyke.codesnap) VSCode extension.

That's much better ðŸ¤© Smooth corners and simple plain background give a much nicer look.

I hope this extension will be useful for you like for me
