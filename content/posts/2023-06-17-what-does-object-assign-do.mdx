This one is easy. It just merges properties of one object with the properties of another one.

Let's look at an example:

```typescript
const person = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30,
  gender: "male",
};

const horse = {
  name: "Spirit",
  age: 20,
  color: "brown",
};

const centaur = Object.assign(person, horse);
console.log('centaur:', centaur)
/*
  {
    name: 'Spirit',
    age: 20,
    gender: 'male',
    color: 'brown'
  }
*/

```

As you can see, the new `centaur` object got the properties from `person` and `horse` objects.

However, something interesting to watch out for is that `person`'s properties "name" and "age" were overwritten by the exact `horse`'s properties as they had higher precedence in this method call.
