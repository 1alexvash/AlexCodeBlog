Historically, this blog has been all about productivity, and here I am back again with yet another cool tool for making you better.

This is not [GitHub Copilot](https://alex-code.com/post/2023-07-17-github-copilot-my-1year-experience), but it is a slightly different tool, though, which can level up your productivity in a slightly different way.

Which really helps with solving problems in a creative way, which is especially useful when tackling a more abstract kind of problem like for example if you do lots of back-end data input and output transformations, then this tool will be golden for you.

### Example

Let's see the first, and really the major feature of this tool, which is instant output logging:

### Second example

Let's add a simple testing function to make things more interesting

```typescript
type AssertEqual = {
  actual: any;
  expected: any;
};

export const assertEqual = ({ actual, expected }: AssertEqual) => {
  if (actual === expected) {
    return `✅ ${actual} === ${expected}`;
  } else {
    return `❌ Failed: Expected ${expected}, but got ${actual}`;
  }
};
```

I am using a TypeScript example in here, but you are free to remove the typing part, in case you are using JavaScript.

This tool with its instant feedback will save you a massive amount of time of unnecessary code compiling, so you can solve problems faster.

I also found this tool extremely useful when I am problem-solving at [Codewars](https://alex-code.com/post/2023-01-21-i-tried-codewars-for-30-days) platform.

### In summary

This tool has also a couple of extra features, but I think I covered 80% of it, sp try it for yourself, and let me know how it goes.
