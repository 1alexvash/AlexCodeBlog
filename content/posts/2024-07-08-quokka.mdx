Historically this blog has been all about productivity, and here I am back again with yet another tool for making you better.

This is not [GitHub Copilot](https://alex-code.com/post/2023-07-17-github-copilot-my-1year-experience), but it is a slightly different tool, though which can level up your productivity in a slightly different way.

Which really helps with solving problems in a creative way, which is especially useful when tackling a more abstract kind of problem like for example if you do lots of back-end data input and output tranfsormations, then this tool will be golden for you.

@@@example example example, and then the article is basically ready

@intro

@purpose

@demo

@example (month example, is there's anything easy?)

@it is good for testing for functions?

@premises

@any use cases?
