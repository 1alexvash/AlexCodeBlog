I just finished reading it, so you don't have to.

It's probably not the book I would recommend.

***

## Why so?

Long story short, I was looking for the next book to get "me ahead in my craft" and stumbled across this one with a catchy title.

But, the book didn't really deliver to expectations as most of the concepts were really basic, like what is "DRY" pattern and why it is important.

I mean if you are a starter, go ahead as you're probably going to like it as the title is quite simple, so you'll read through it quickly.

Overall, it felt like the book didn't really have a strong narrative and just covered random subjects from here and there. Therefore, it felt like the author didn't actually make a solid point about anything in particular which worsened the delivery experience. Thus, it's hard to recommend it as an awesome read.
