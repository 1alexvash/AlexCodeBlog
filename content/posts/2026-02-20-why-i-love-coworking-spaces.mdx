Working remotely from home is everyone's modern dream, so I was a bit on the fence when a buddy of mine suggested trying out one of those coworking spaces.

As I just thought of it as an expensive quiet ☕️ cafe, but I could not be more wrong than that.

And it feels good to be wrong! – So let me share what I have learned!

## Cowork advantages:

### #1 Ergonomics

So the very first advantage over working in traditional cafes is that you always have a bigger desk to work one. If you are paying for the dedicates desk option, you are almost not limited at all, so you can put even three monitors on your desk or the exact amount needed for the type of work. Something that isn't always possible from a cafe.

// Also, in coworking spaces you usually get the best chairs or the napping room. Like some small notetaker might actually make you rethink your homework setup.

// And just watching your peers and their setup might make you reconsider the way you do the work, so that's definitely a good place to get inspired.

### #2 Peers

Coworking spaces are the best place to meet like-minded interesting people who also work in tech.

Since you both work in tech, it'll be one of the most interesting encounters in your life.

Like for example I met a language-learning enthusiast who learned five foreign languages and who was building his competitor app to kill Duolingo. And it was the most interesting encounter of my entire 2025, and it would not happen if i would not jump to try to work in the coworking space.

### #3 Fresh air commute

In the big city you are free to pick some coworking space near your house, and there's almost some magic about it. Just walking out of your building and getting to the workplace immediately sets you up in the proper workstate, as when you work from home you are kind of always at home, so it is harder to transition to that proper “work state”.

* Work & life balance (combine it with the previous one)
* Fresh Air / Commute
* Work rates
* Rest is rest
* Meeting space
* Quitness
* Locker
* Loneliness/Community
* Pricing/drinks
* Work only atmosphere
