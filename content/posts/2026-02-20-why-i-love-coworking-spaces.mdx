Working remotely from home is everyone's modern dream, so I was a bit on the fence when a buddy of mine suggested trying out one of those coworking spaces.

As I just thought of it as an expensive quiet ☕️ cafe, but I could not be more wrong than that.

And it feels good to be wrong! – So let me share what I have learned!

# Cowork advantages:

* Peers
* Ergonomics
* Work & life balance
* Fresh Air / Commute
* Work rates
* Rest is rest
* Meeting space
* Quitness
* Locker
* Loneliness/Community
