Working remotely from home is everyone's modern dream, so I was a bit on the fence when a buddy of mine suggested trying out one of those coworking spaces.

As I just thought of it as an expensive quiet ☕️ cafe, but I could not be more wrong than that.

And it feels good to be wrong! – So let me share what I have learned!

## Cowork advantages:

### 1 Ergonomics

So the very first advantage over working in traditional cafes is that you always have a bigger desk to work one. If you are paying for the dedicates desk option, you are almost not limited at all, so you can put even three monitors on your desk or the exact amount needed for the type of work. Something that isn't always possible from a cafe.

// Also, in coworking spaces you usually get the best chairs or the napping room. Like some small notetaker might actually make you rethink your homework setup.

// And just watching your peers and their setup might make you reconsider the way you do the work, so that's definitely a good place to get inspired.

### 2 Peers

Coworking spaces are the best place to meet like-minded interesting people who also work in tech.

Since you both work in tech, it'll be one of the most interesting encounters in your life.

Like for example I met a language-learning enthusiast who learned five foreign languages and who was building his competitor app to kill Duolingo. And it was the most interesting encounter of my entire 2025, and it would not happen if i would not jump to try to work in the coworking space.

### 3 Work life balance

The problem of working from home, is that you are never technically in "home" as you are always technically in the office area working. So if you post your work hours you receive some quick email to look at then you technically working 9 or 10 hours not 8.

Coworking space creates this strong boundary, so work stays at work, and home becomes for leisure and rest.

So almost ironically that by going to the coworking space you will work less as the quality of your work hours will increase.



### 4 Fresh air commute

In the big city you are free to pick some coworking space near your house, and there's almost some magic about it. Just walking out of your building and getting to the workplace immediately sets you up in the proper workstate, as when you work from home you are kind of always at home, so it is harder to transition to that proper “workstate”.

### 5 Higher workrates levels

This is an individual experience, but I noticed precisely that when you work from home you never actually “resting”, so the quality of your work hour is actually really lower.

Since working at home it is hard to achieve a proper transition towards the proper work state, so mind wandering is common and the quality of your work is much more shallow than if you were to work in your office space.

### 6 Meeting space

One huge advantage coworking spaces have over working in cafes is that there's no loud music, and there is always a quiet space to jump and run any meeting you want, so you can do the actual work and coordindate with people.

* Meeting space
* Quitness
* Locker
* Loneliness/Community
* Pricing/drinks
* Work only atmosphere
