Working remotely from home is everyone's modern dream, so I was a bit on the fence when a buddy of mine suggested trying out one of those coworking spaces.

As I just thought of it as an expensive quiet ☕️ cafe, but I could not be more wrong than that.

And it feels good to be wrong! – So let me share what I have learned!

## Coworking spaces advantages:

### 1 Ergonomics

So the very first advantage over working in traditional cafes is that you always have a bigger desk to work one. If you are paying for the dedicates desk option, you are almost not limited at all, so you can put even three monitors on your desk or the exact amount needed for the type of work. Something that isn't always possible from a cafe.

// Also, in coworking spaces you usually get the best chairs or the napping room. Like some small notetaker might actually make you rethink your homework setup.

// And just watching your peers and their setup might make you reconsider the way you do the work, so that's definitely a good place to get inspired.

### 2 Peers

Coworking spaces are the best place to meet like-minded interesting people who also work in tech.

Since you both work in tech, it'll be one of the most interesting encounters in your life.

Like for example I met a language-learning enthusiast who learned five foreign languages and who was building his competitor app to kill Duolingo. And it was the most interesting encounter of my entire 2025, and it would not happen if i would not jump to try to work in the coworking space.

### 3 Work life balance

The problem of working from home, is that you are never technically in "home" as you are always technically in the office area working. So if you post your work hours you receive some quick email to look at then you technically working 9 or 10 hours not 8.

Coworking space creates this strong boundary, so work stays at work, and home becomes for leisure and rest.

So almost ironically that by going to the coworking space you will work less as the quality of your work hours will increase.

### 4 Fresh air commute

In the big city you are free to pick some coworking space near your house, and there's almost some magic about it. Just walking out of your building and getting to the workplace immediately sets you up in the proper workstate, as when you work from home you are kind of always at home, so it is harder to transition to that proper “workstate”.

### 5 Higher workrates levels

This is an individual experience, but I noticed precisely that when you work from home you never actually “resting”, so the quality of your work hour is actually really lower.

Since working at home it is hard to achieve a proper transition towards the proper work state, so mind wandering is common and the quality of your work is much more shallow than if you were to work in your office space.

### 6 Meeting space

One huge advantage coworking spaces have over working in cafes is that there's no loud music, and there is always a quiet space to jump and run any meeting you want, so you can do the actual work and coordinate with people.

// It's like a profesional shirt, it already looks serious as it shows intent, you can't get that when you have loud cafe music.

### 7 Quietness

Similarly, it depends on with whom you live, even at home you can't always get that quietness, but that's like the core feature of the coworking space, so that's definitely a place to get it.

### 8 Locker

// This one is like a bonus one, but when you travel there's this like extrat tip if you haven't picked a regular place to stay, then a coworking space might offer you a place to put your stuff making your more flexible to explore the area especially when you are travelling

### 9 Sense of community

I'm leaning towards more extroverted side as I love spending time with people, and I don't like being alone for a long period, so take my word with a bit of a grain of salt, so working from home feels lonely without any human interactions for a long period, so I don't really like it.

And having your personal coworking space you can come to is a perfect solution for that. It's not like I even need to interact with people in that WeWork like office, but it just seeing other people working around creates a very good working atmosphere and environment, and there is just something that raises my mood as I guess people evolved to live in tribes, so it just feels good like life is happening when people are around you.

So a coworking space just makes my modern jungles a lot more entertaining when I'm not a single person in the cave working.

### 10 Drinks & snacks

Okay, this is an interesting one. I heard many times the argument that you are almost paying for the free space you can get in that same cafe, but that's simply not correct if you do apply basic math.

First of all coworking desk space is a lot better than a typical Starbucks coffee table.

Secondly, if you multiply the price of a morning Starbucks latte that's already like 20 drinks a month you are already paying for, considering you go there every working day. If you hop in a cafe twice a day that's like already 40 drinks a month.

In a coworking space a free coffee machine is usually a basic perk included in one month's flat payment, so by replacing your Starbucks space with the WeWork like your personal office space you will already save the money for the office, and you will have so much more!

## Bottom line

Discovering coworking spaces was a big find for my personal life and my productivity levels. And if you get a chance to try it out I highly suggest it, as you might be like me very surprised by the extra edge that this unique space adds to the quality of your life.
