The reduce function reduces the entire array to a single value, so you can perform powerful operations like summing the total value or finding the average.

### Syntax

Let's have a glimpse of syntax to understand what we are dealing with:

```javascript
array.reduce((accumulator, currentValue, currentIndex, array) => {
  // ...
}, initialValue);
```

* accumulator - the value we are accumulating
* currentValue - current element we're looking at (fun examples below â¬‡)
* currentIndex - current element index (optional)
* array - the initial array the method was called on (optional)

### Easy example

Let's say we have different baskets with fruits, and we want to count the total number of fruits.

Then .reduce function comes to the rescue.

```javascript
const basketsWithFruits = [5, 10, 15, 20];

const totalFruits = basketsWithFruits.reduce(
  (total, fruitBasketCount) => total + fruitBasketCount
);

console.log("totalFruits:", totalFruits); // totalFruits: 50
```

To break it down it step by step:

```javascript
// Initial step: Add the first basket count (5) to the running total (0). Total becomes 5.
// Step 1) Add the second basket count (10) to the current total (5). Total becomes 15.
// Step 2) Add the third basket count (15) to the current total (15). Total becomes 30.
// Step 3) Add the fourth basket count (20) to the current total (30). Total becomes 50.

```

Beautiful. Let's go to a more complex example.

### Advanced example

Let's say we have a banking user system.

Here's our account:

```javascript
const bankAccount = {
  fullName: "Alex Smith",
  balance: 3000,
}
```

Let's say we purchased a couple of products:

```javascript
const payments = [
  { amount: 200, description: "Product 1" },
  { amount: 400, description: "Product 2" },
  { amount: 600, description: "Product 3" },
]
```

And we want to calculate the price of the bill for product

That's the way the final code will look like

```javascript
const bankAccount = {
  fullName: "Alex Smith",
  balance: 3000,
}

const payments = [
  { amount: 200, description: "Product 1" },
  { amount: 400, description: "Product 2" },
  { amount: 600, description: "Product 3" },
]

const initialValue = 0;

const bill = payments.reduce((acc, payment) => {
  return acc + payment.amount;
}, initialValue);

// subtract bill from bankAccount balance
bankAccount.balance -= bill;

// print the new balance
console.log(bankAccount.balance); // 1800
```
