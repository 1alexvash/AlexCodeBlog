The easiest way to undo the last commit I've ever seen.

This trick is a golden nugget.

In your Visual Studio Code open control panel.

By clicking **Shift + P**

![](http://localhost/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/image.png)And then hit the command, and that's it!

It so damn simple! I really love this trick.

_(One last detail: this command doesn't remove files you committed, just moves them in the staging area)_
