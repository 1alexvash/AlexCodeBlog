With all that going on in the AI world, I was looking for some beginner-friendly book to the machine learning subject.

I have already posted in the past about [one book](https://alex-code.com/admin#/~/post/2023-07-18-one-hundred-page-machine-learning-book) on this subject, but this was not the book I could recommend, as it would leave you more confused before you read it.

So I was lucky enough to find something decent that I can proudly recommend.

## Why is this new book really good?

First of all, it's a really simple and beginner-friendly book, and it does deliver on its title.

Secondly, this book prompts you to think about solving different challenges, and then shows how to go about them. This a much more effective way of learning than just talking about plain theory or showing you a complete example. As the ultimate goal of the book, it is to teach you to think.

Thirdly, despite its short size, the author manages to dive into of plenty of AI related subjects which, in my opinion, works really great, as it maintains a perfect balance: the book does not get far too overwhelmingly nerdy, but at the same time it manages to give you a brief overview of the whole machine learning domain.

Fourthly, related to the previous point, the book manages to cover plenty of subjects, as it moves quickly from a subject to subject, it really keeps you engaged and entertained throughout the whole book journey.

In total, this book was much better than the last one, as I felt more educated on the subject after reading it.

## What's inside the book?

The story starts with a brief history of computing, and how we come to be with AI and its applications, when to apply it or not and its possible power, what's the data scrubbing and why do we need data, and how to get data for models.

Next it goes over a couple of practical examples of AI problems, so you get an idea of what's the AI engineering is like, how it is different from a regular computer engineering, also meanwhile you are asked to think about solving those machine learning problems, like thinking whether a certain piece of data is relevant to the data set, or whether we should exclude it from our model, as it does nothing good for the overall prediction.

\#Next we are slightly leveling up, as we start working 

\#And then finally the book ends with a very concise, 2 page, Python language syntax breakdown, as it is the most popular language you are likely to use for machine learning.
