With all that going on in the AI world, I was looking for some beginner-friendly book to the machine learning subject.

I have already posted in the past about [one book](https://alex-code.com/admin#/~/post/2023-07-18-one-hundred-page-machine-learning-book) on this subject, but this was not the book I could recommend, as it would leave you more confused before you read it.

So I was lucky enough to find something decent that I can proudly recommend.
