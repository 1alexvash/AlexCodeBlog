Why wouldn't you want to make better decisions? I mean your success in life literally depends on it.

If you are anything like me, there's one particular type of decisions which tends to get you stuck in your head. It's when you have both equally compelling options to chose from, and you don't know which.

For that particular type of situation I have developed a system, and a simple heuristic rule you can apply.

But, let's start off from an example.

Let's say you had dinner, and you want something for a snack, fruit for example, but you only have a place for a single one.

You think for 10 minutes, then 20, and eventually 30 minutes, and by then you decide, I'll probably pass it until tomorrow, as you are so mentally ðŸ¤¯ deprived by this point.

I mean this example is a little bit ðŸ¤ª ridiculous, right?

But, that's exactly how the procrastination looks from the outside.

So let's get to workaround.

### Solution

It's pretty simple, just pick any option, flip the damn coin.

Let's compare two people:

> Overthinker vs Action Taker

Which one you want to be? I hope the second one.

So as you can see a lot of time is saved, and I hope this time it can be used for important stuff.

And I think, it's a very good way to live your life.
