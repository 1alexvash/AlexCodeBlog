Sometimes people do not distinguish those methods and write code like this:

```javascript
const numbers = [5, 10, 10];

numbers.forEach((number) => console.log("number:", number));

// instead of this:

numbers.map((number) => console.log("number:", number));

// the output for both methods:
// number: 5
// number: 10
// number: 10
```

They think hence the output is the same. They must do the same thing. But there's a nuance to it.

> **forEach** method is used for iteration

> While \*\*map \*\*method is used for modifing an and returning new updated array

### Example

Let's say you want to create a copy of doubled numbers.

```javascript
const numbers = [5, 10, 10];
const doubledNumbers = numbers.forEach((number) => number * 2);
console.log("doubledNumbers:", doubledNumbers); // undefined

```

Huh, then for this case forEach method won't cut it.

Let's try again with map method.

```javascript
const numbers = [5, 10, 10];
const doubledNumbers = numbers.map((number) => number * 2);
console.log("doubledNumbers:", doubledNumbers); // [ 10, 20, 20 ] 
```

It did the job!

### Why this is important

Code reflecting clear intent is crucial for scalability and collaboration. Neglecting this aspect can make it harder to scale the app and work with the codebase.

### Test

Let's say we have a base of users, and we want to send them a present.

```javascript
function sendPresent(user) {
  // ...
}

const users = [
  { name: 'Tom', age: 17 },
  { name: 'Bob', age: 23 },
  { name: 'Alice', age: 18 },
];
```

Now, we need to iterate to through the list of users. Which method will you choose?
