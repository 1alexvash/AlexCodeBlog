Let's start from the definition: A pure function is a function that always returns the same output for the same input and has no side effects.

For example:

```javascript
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

add(1, 2); // 3
add(2, 3); // 5
add(3, 4); // 7
```

@code example

@what does this actually mean

(from gpt: Pure functions are important in functional programming because they are predictable, testable, and easier to reason about. They help reduce bugs and make code more maintainable.)
