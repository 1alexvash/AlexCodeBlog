Let's start from the definition: A pure function is a function that always returns the same output for the same input and has no side effects.

Pure function example ✅

```javascript
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

add(1, 2); // 3
add(2, 3); // 5
add(3, 4); // 7
```

Same input, leads to the same output. Anytime and everytime.

Impure function example ❌

```javascript
const user = {
  name: "John",
  balance: 1000,
}

function withdraw(amount) {
  const updatedValue = user.balance -= amount;
  return updatedValue;
}
```

The problem with this one is that it depends on the value outside of its scope, that's why it has side effects and cannot be properly tested.

### The bottom line

In summary, a pure function always produces the same output for the same input and avoids side effects, while an impure function relies on external values, leading to unpredictability and testing challenges.
