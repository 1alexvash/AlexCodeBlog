I'm going to split this article in 2 parts, in the first part, I'm going to \*last out\* on the platform, in the second going to discuss positive parts of wordpress, so at the end you're going to make your informed decision.

Without further ado, why wordpress sucks:

\- buggy editor, a couple of examples.

\- buggy platform, "create post", doesn't don't show up sometimes

\- Slow due to the nature of PHP render, I mean 1 or 2 extra seconds of load won't kill your business, but it will decrease customer satisfaction. I just hope the value of your content / product worth extra wait.

\- Very heavy in size, if you want just work with content: by posting, editing, and removing, you're going to need to install dozens of plugins, just to make it work.

\- Lots of spam wordpress plugins, it's super annoying to receive the spam from your own website, and then just to google on how to turn them off, and realize, there's no other way than installing another pluging, to shut those notifications off ðŸ¤¯

\- boilerplate is terrible, there are dozens of tabs in the admin panel you won't ever going to need which are going to make a nightmare to find the one you need occasionaly.

\- Platform is hard to enhance, if you ever going to need extra feature beyound the set of classical blog feature, best luck to you

\- Bad structure. If you're coming with the front-end background / mindset, working with wordpress is going to be a nightmare for you. As to edit a file, you'll need to go to special editor in the WP system, and edit those .php files. And let me tell you, this editor sucks, as it doesn't have nice editor features like autoformatting text.

\- Developoing sucks, to set up a server, you need to install a fuckload of database configs, different kind of server instructions, to develop locally you're going to need about to install about 5 different probrams, pushing those changes is another nightmare, and it just doesn't worth the hustle.

\- Platform doesn't feel secure overall, after your receive a dozens of spam messages on just barely published website. In this case popularity actually hurts wordpress, as there's a plenty of hackers looking to hack, and blackmail you website, so you need to constantly watch out for news, for the latest plugin to fix some new vulnarability.

Didn't I mention but just to make sure your website is secure, you need to install a package of different secureity plugings? Can you imagine it? It just doesn't feel like the wordpress was very well designed.
