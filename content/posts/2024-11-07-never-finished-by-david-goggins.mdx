David Goggins is a spiritual role model of mine, and seeing his comeback with the second book is a beautiful thing to witness.

Especially, considering that the second book is better than the first one, the legend did it again.

How rare is that? Do you know many movies like Top Gun, for example, where's the second part is better than the first one? I don't  have that many examples to name to be honest.

The first book introduced us to the story of David Goggins, about all of the challenges and trials of racism, growing up in a bad neighborhood and with a fucked up family, but still succeeding despite those incredible odds.

So from the second book my expectations were to hear more stories, like from the first book incentivizing people to do almost an autistic style of self-improvement by almost killing themselves by working harder until eventually they might succeed or what not, but this is not how it went, and it's for good, as it means the David has grown up, his attitudes changed, and he became a better version of himself.

I'm not going to spoil it for you, but the basic narrative of the second book in a nutshell is that David didn't really enjoy his fame, even though he became a popular famous speaker making with some speeches more money than he used to make in a year before in a regular job, and while he was having those invitations scheduled for the whole month in his calendar. He didn't really find much joy in it, as it was not fulfilling his soul, so he decided to take on another challenge by becoming a pararescue to fight with wild forest fires.

It was really great to see other facets of his personality, and to find more complexity and story to his legendary character.

In the rest of the book he takes you through the wonderful journey of incredible stories meanwhile introducing plenty of interesting concepts like "maximizing minimal potential" or "mental lab".

In the end, read this story if you are as a big fan of David as I am, so you can also enjoy this story as much as did, because I believe that extreme hard work is a great equalizer in the game of life, and the David is the best man to spread this message.
