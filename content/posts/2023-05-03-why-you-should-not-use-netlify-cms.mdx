Long story short: before Netlify CMS, I used WordPress on this blog, but it was very verbose. There were dozens of extra configs I never ever needed.

So, as a typical software developer, I was looking to try something new. (dumbass ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è)

And I happened to jump on this thing called Netlify CMS created by a popular hosting platform Netlify.

When I checked it out it was as minimalistic and essential as it can possibly get. So, I was hooked right away.

The problem is that this Content Management System simply did not deliver on my expectations.

Even though, it is minimalistic and has only a couple of features. It struggles with their delivery.

One example of such a malfunctioned feature:
