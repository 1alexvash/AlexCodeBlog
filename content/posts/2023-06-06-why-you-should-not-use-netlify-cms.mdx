Long story short: before Netlify CMS, I used WordPress on this blog, but it was very verbose. There were dozens of extra configs I never ever needed.

So, as a typical software developer, I was looking to try something new. (dumbass ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è)

And I happened to jump on this thing called Netlify CMS created by a popular hosting platform Netlify.

When I checked it out it was as minimalistic and essential as it can possibly get. So, I was hooked right away.

The problem is that this Content Management System simply did not deliver on its expectations.

Even though, it is minimalistic and has only a couple of features. It struggles with their delivery.

One example of such a malfunctioned feature is disappearing emojis:

This is not a major thing, but there are plenty of more bugs like this one, and those bugs add up causing bigger and bigger anxiety.

But really the worst part is the inactive developer community on GitHub. It's been rumored that the Netlify CMS lead left the project, and the technology is not maintained anymore.

### The bottom line:

If you are looking into trying Netlify CMS, pass by and try something else.
