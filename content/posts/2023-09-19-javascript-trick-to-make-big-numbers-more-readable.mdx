Have you ever seen numbers like this?

```javascript
const fiveMillion = 5_000_000;
```

What about this?

```javascript
const oneBillion = 1_000_000_000;
```

This is totally valid JavaScript syntax, those numbers are treated as regular numbers, there's a proof:

```javascript
const fiveMillion = 5_000_000;

const oneBillion = 1_000_000_000;

const sum = fiveMillion + oneBillion;
console.log('sum:', sum); // sum: 1005000000
```

### What's the trick?

It is just a nice new feature called "numeric separator",  introduced in ECMAScript 2021 (ES12).

These underscores are ignored by the JavaScript engine and are purely for readability purposes.
