First thing you need to realize if you were given an opportunity to mentor is that:

Mentoring is primarily **beneficial** to you.

I know this can be a little counterintuitive, when somebody constantly asks you questions, and doesn't let you concentrate on work, so let me explain.

## Benefits:

### Deep knowledge

Mentoring somebody is going to help you reach true wisdom in your field.

You can't teach something without having a solid foundation of the subject.

By trying to explain something to the other person, you'll quickly expose wholes in your understanding.

Not only that, it'll teach you to dissect important information, from not so important.

Surprisingly, by teaching, you'll notice that you are learning the way you never learned before.

Only that is good enough for me, but let's proceed.

### Soft-skills

You talk to people, you get better at communication, and delivering your point.

Critical skill for the next point.

### Leadership

This skill grows out of the previous one.

Only by being a good communicator, you'll be able to get a \***\*team-lead\*\*** position.

I mean, nobody wants to deal with a jerk, so this one critical.

### Persuasiveness

Sometimes you'll have to defend your technical decisions, as you might hear a question like, "Why we are using X technology over Y".

Your interns might not know some subtle details about the way your projects works.

Thinking deeply about those questions will bring out a lot of clarity in your mind, and in your speech.

So, once you talk preciously, people will listen, and follow your ideas.

### Confidence

Remember this time, when you just started your career, not knowing what to do, having a ton of anxiety, scaring to do the wrong thing?

And contrast it with where you are right now. Helping others in the same position you were before.

Solving other people problems after the experience of not being able to solve yours own.

It just feels like anything else, and it is a definitely a great confidence booster.

### Delegation

By mentoring others, you'll notice one interesting thing. You'll spend more time delegating, and code reviewing, instead of writing code.

Spending less time doing your favorite activity of writing code definitely might feel sad sometimes.

But! Consider the benefits.

Code reviewing is going to help you find best practices.

Delegation will help you to think deeper about problems, as to make this task done, you'll have to break it down in smaller steps, and explain to a person who is less experienced than you steps on how to get it done.

This kind of tasks will help you develop big picture vision crucial for professional growth and getting to another level in your career.

### It feels good

Helping others feels good, and it gives you some inner fulfillment.

So go for it, and be a great mentor!
