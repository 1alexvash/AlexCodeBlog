This article is not relevant to this blog, but it might very well be very relevant to your life.

A year ago, I did this procedure called cool sculpting which basically freezes off and kills fat.

I tried it on my chin to improve the appearance of my jawline.

### The problem is: People are shallow

When a person on the street with dirty clothes approaches me on the street, I automatically assume they might be homeless or drinkers anyway they are up to something not good, so instantly try to get away from them to not associate myself with them.

I know this is shallow, it is NOT nice, it is not politically correct, but what can you do when a stranger smells kind of funny?

### The halo effect

The complete opposite of this is the halo effect it is when a nice person in an expensive fitted suit enters the room, and you start running assumptions about their work, intelligence, wife and car etc.

I'm sorry again for those stereotypes, but it is our nature to pair up with the best genetics to ensure survival of our species.

After 7 years of going to the gym and gaining muscles, the amount of respect I receive from other men is totally from a different world then back when I was skinny.

### The Jawline

The jawline is kind of funny BECAUSE it is not really about the jawline, but WHAT it communicates.

Let's say we have two people:

Josh, he has double chin, your first thoughts:

* He is lazy
* He doesn't work out
* Probably has low testosterone
* Has bad eating habits and diet

Jake, he has a good jawline, your first thoughts:

\*\* Results are overexaggerated as I did not see this difference in my own personal before and after photos. It feels like the specialist conducting this procedure took a photo with a really good lighting consciously or unconsciously to really "sell" the results.

\*\*\* Though the specialist itself admitted that those results are a bit above average of what you can expect from this procedure. 

### Should I do this procedure?

I think no, as you can get even better results for free just by having a good mouth posture.

Which basically means things like:

* Eating with small bites
* Eating with your mouth closed
* Swallowing the food with your tongue
* Having a good neck posture.

Basically, just by doing following the "Mewing" technique, I'm sorry if it sounds like a cringe to you, but I believe the results do slowly and slightly add up if you stick to it for years.
