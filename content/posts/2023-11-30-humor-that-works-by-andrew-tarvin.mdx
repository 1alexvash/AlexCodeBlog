Before reading this article any further, I would suggest jumping off my blog and checking the Author's [TED talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iFCm5ZokBI), as the actual picture worth a thousand of words.

I am a huge fun of any book that can increase the quality of my life, and take me to the next level in something, and this was definitely the one, as I updated my views on certain things after reading this book.

I like fun at work, but sometimes it was hard to strike the right balance and figure how much humor is too much or whether a certain joke is appropriate for a certain job meeting.

And this book came with really high-quality answers for those questions.

So let's firstly explore the humor benefits.

### Humor benefits

Let's start off from the mindset shift.

Did you know that humor:

1. Humor improves productivity
2. Humor reduces stress.
3. Humor prevents burnout
4. Humor provides motivation
5. Humor increases size of paycheck

And it's only the tip of the iceberg!

There are actually 30 scientifically proven benefits to humor. ([source](https://www.humorthatworks.com/benefits/30-benefits-of-humor-at-work/))

### What if I am afraid to joke at work?

Previous excerpt might have got you interested, but what if you are just afraid to joke?

This is a really interesting point to cover, and it's quite easy to understand you.

What those studies also found is that when you joke and other people laugh, it actually **increases your perceived level of competence**.

And what's more surprising is when other people don't actually laugh at your joke, **it makes zero** difference in your perceived level of competence and credibility, as people do not notice it and just go about their day, so you actually have nothing to lose, but only to gain!

You need to actually practice humor because that's the only way you can get better at it!

Let's say at work, we have two people, Rebecca and Alex.

Rebecca is just not fun because she never jokes, and she will never be, as she does not even try.

Alex, on the other hand, practices humor most of the time, with everyone. If his joke did not work with one coworker, he's searching for a way to reiterate by changing his voice tonality to make the next coworker die from laughter.

And that's exactly why Alex is funny while Rebecca is not.

All because Alex is constantly alternating and improving his approach, which leads to better reactions from others.

### Practical examples

I have some personal real life anecdotes, so it will give you a clearer idea on how to apply humor at work.

First story:

In the project I was working on, I was given a big new feature to implement, but instead of coding it straight away, I found a much easier way to implement this functionality by using some external tools which saved the company at least 2 weeks of work.

My manager obviously praised me for this, but I did answer saying, "Oh, you definitely did not expect such a clever idea out of my head".  And my manager laughed about this.

What is interesting in this story is not what I am explicitly saying, but what I'm implicitly communicating.

> Explicitly - I said, "I'm dumb".

> Implicitly - I told, "Look, I am humble and down to earth, you can relate and trust me!".

And this is the power of humor!

Second story:

This story was not as positive as the first one. I missed a deadline for a big feature by a week and my manager asked me for some analysis, and answered with, "Oh, you expected a longer delay. Didn't you?". Which made him laugh again.

> Explicitly - I dodged the question

> Implicitly - I acknowledged the complexity of this feature and highlighted my efforts on brining this feature on time

Which turned the situation positive once again.

***

As you can see, humor can be a powerful thing.

And it is more about what you are implicitly communicating rather than what you say with your words alone.

The book has a chapter on different types of humor, so it can give you even more ideas on how to apply humor in your work and life.

### Bottom line

As it turns out, by a conducted research, humor at work can increase your chances of getting a job, staying on the job and even getting promoted.

It even explains the hidden reason behind why some people are more likable than others.

But what really matters is making somebody smile and happy that day.

And that's I think, a good enough reason in itself to check out "Humor That Works" by Andrew Tarvin.
