Have you ever had this case when Visual Studio Code was acting kind of funny?

For example, maybe you had some annoying error in the console, and you knew for sure, this error was not because of your or your code, but because of the editor.

So, you had to shut it, and restart the project entirely, just to verify that you were right, as since the restart the error magically gone?

I've been there, I know this annoying feeling, but luckily, there's a solution.

### Let's check the demo:

That's about it!

I hope this tip will be serving you well, and you'll be able to save some time.
