Programming concepts might sound very scary.

Especially this one with OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) – it just a combination of three scary letters.

But in fact all of this is a lot easier than it sounds.

So let's try to take a simple 🛳️ submarine game as an example to see the difference between those two fundamental coding patterns and approaches.

### OOP way

If you would create your game with the Object Oriented Programing way, your app and submarine would roughly look something like this.

```javascript
const submarine = {
  move(direction) {
    // Moving
  },

  attack(target) {
    // Attacking
  },

  upgrade(system) {
    // Upgrading
  }
};

```

So then in the OOP way you will be able to run and command with your submarine like this

```javascript
submarine.move("UP");
submarine.upgrade("Shiled_Level_2")
submarine.upgrade("Speed_Level_3")
```

### Functional programming way

In a purely functional way, without any inspiration from the object style your functionality would like something as follows:

```javascript
function move(direction) {
  return direction;
}

function attack(target) {
  // Attacking
}

function upgrade(system) {
  // Upgrading
}

```

Very simple, right?

## Conclusion

Those two programming concepts aren't as scary as they seem.

Honestly, they almost mostly look like the same thing.

In essence, in the OOP way, you send `O(f)` while in the functional way `f(O)`

Functional is easier to understand and beginner friendly, but otherwise…

angular/nestjs | react is functional…
