Programming concepts might sound very scary.

Especially this one called OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) – it just a combination of three scary letters.

But in fact all of this is a lot easier than it sounds.

So to really see that in action, let's build a simple 🛳️ submarine game using both approaches.

### OOP way

If you would create your game with the object-oriented programming way, your app and submarine would roughly look something like this.

```javascript
const submarine = {
  move(direction) {
    // Moving
  },

  attack(target) {
    // Attacking
  },

  upgrade(system) {
    // Upgrading
  }
};

```

And then in the OOP way you will be able to run and command with your submarine like this:

```javascript
submarine.move("UP");
submarine.upgrade("Shiled_Level_2")
submarine.upgrade("Speed_Level_3")
```

### Functional programming way

In a purely functional way, without any inspiration from the object style your functionality would like something as follows:

```javascript
function move(direction) {
    // Moving
}

function attack(target) {
  // Attacking
}

function upgrade(system) {
  // Upgrading
}

```

Very simple, right?

## Bottom line

As you can see the first approach is based around objects as the core unit of organizing the code while the second around functions, but in essence, both of those approaches they are doing the same thing, they just help run and help you organize your program, and in the real-world application, you are in fact probably using both of those approaches at the same time.

It's just that modern frameworks like React they lean more heavily towards a more functional and beginner friendly programming way, while other frameworks like Angular or NestJS lean towards the OOP way.

The first approach expects `O(f)` function as an argument for your object, while the second `f(O)` object as an argument to your function, and at the end of the day things can be done both ways, so indeed nothing complicated here, right?
