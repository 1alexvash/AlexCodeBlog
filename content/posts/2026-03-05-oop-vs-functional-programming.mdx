Programming concepts might sound very scary. Especially this one, OOP it is essentially an abbreviation of three scarty letters.

But in fact all of this is a lot easier than it sounds.

So let's try to take a simple submarine game as an example to see the difference between those two fundamental coding patterns and approaches.

### Functional programming way
