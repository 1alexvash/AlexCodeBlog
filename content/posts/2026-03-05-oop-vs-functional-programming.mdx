Programming concepts might sound very scary.

Especially this one with OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) – it just a combination of three scary letters.

But in fact all of this is a lot easier than it sounds.

So let's try to take a simple 🛳️ submarine game as an example to see the difference between those two fundamental coding patterns and approaches.

### OOP way

If you would create your game with the Object Oriented Programing way, your app and submarine would roughly look something like this.

```javascript
const submarine = {
  move(direction) {
    // Moving
  },

  attack(target) {
    // Attacking
  },

  upgrade(system) {
    // Upgrading
  }
};

```

So than in the OOP way you will be able to run operation like this

```javascript
```

### Functional programming way

note…


## Conclusion

conclusion roughly the same, but O(f) vs F(o)…, angular/nestjs | react is functional
