Let's say we have a kid, Jeffrey. Jeffrey plays computer games, and he can't kill the final Dragon in the game.

He's been struggling to kill this dragon for weeks, and is almost willing to give up, but tricky marketers came to the rescue by tricking him into buying a `Dragon Slayer Sword`, only for `$9.99`, and so Jeffrey is hooked.

How would we as developers implement the following logic?

Since this operation involves payment transaction, and storing the information in a database, it is more complex than just simply calling a function `buyItem(sword)`.

@what to show on the illustration?

@should we try to make a gif? yes, we should, it's going to be our first time experiment! it would be cool practice on getting those ones done, it'd be a good presentational experience, so in the future down the line, i might start doing videos or what not

@especially useful with subscription when the event is not send from the client
