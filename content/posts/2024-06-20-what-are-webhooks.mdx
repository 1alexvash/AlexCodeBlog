Let's say we have a kid, Jeffrey. Jeffrey plays computer games, and he can't kill the final Dragon in the game.

He's been struggling to kill this dragon for weeks, and is almost willing to give up, but tricky marketers came to the rescue by tricking him into buying a `Dragon Slayer Sword`, only for `$9.99`, and so Jeffrey is hooked.

How would we as developers implement the following logic?

Since this operation involves payment transaction, and storing the information in a database, it is more complex than just simply calling a function `buyItem(sword)`.

Usually, the way it works, you ask the payment provider, for example Stripe, to issue a user a üìÉ payment invoice. Then the user is being redirected to the stripe payment form. Where it asks the user to provide the payment information for the requested item.

When everything goes well on the Stripe side, and the payment is confirmed, it issues an event, saying 'payment\_intent.succeeded' ‚úÖ and forward this event via ü™ù webhook technology, basically forwarding this event from the stripe webhook URL \`https\://stripe.com/webhooks\` to your web server URL \`https\://yourserver.com/api/buyItem\` where you can securely reward the user with the item he has purchased. In case the payment did not go well, you're going to receive 'payment\_intent.payment\_failed' ‚ùå and can send an according message to the user.

The main benefit of this webhook approach is üõ° security, as the payment itself is not handled by the client, but instead redirected to the stripe payment form, which makes this transaction very secure, so to see your item a couple of things will have to take place:

1. The user pays the Stripe payment form.
2. Stripe acknowledges a payment, and sends a webhook response to your server
3. Your server receives executes backend logic, and rewards a user with an item
4. The item is stored in database
5. And only after all those steps, the client is updated, and the user can his item

@what to show on the illustration?

@should we try to make a gif? yes, we should, it's going to be our first time experiment! it would be cool practice on getting those ones done, it'd be a good presentational experience, so in the future down the line, i might start doing videos or what not

@especially useful with subscription when the event is not send from the client
