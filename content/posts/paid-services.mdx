Hi there!

If you love what I do, then you might be interested in some of the services that I offer

### üé® Design

All the design and artwork on this website is done by the girl called Asya. If you love it as much as I do and would love to work with her, here's her email: [asja.sky.design@gmail.com](mailto\:asja.sky.design@gmail.com)

Her rate is **$25** per hour.

### üíª Development services

I might help you with my developments' expertise if your app or project falls in the realm of my development expertise. Also, to speed up the development, I might help with hiring the right professionals if let's say I'm unavailable at this moment, but I still consider your project of an interest and worthy of help.

### üí∞ Consultation price

My fee is **$100** for a 30-minute consultation

‚úÖ What I can help you with:

* Consulting on some of the technologies mentioned on this blog
* Help with picking technology stack for the project
* Career advice / Technical assessment
* Help with review / code quality
* Tips on hiring people and growing a team

‚ùå What I can't help you with:

My main area of expertise lays primarily in web development, so I won't give you sound advice on mobile development, for example.

### üìß Reaching me

You can locate my email in the top header section of this website. Feel free to reach out with your request, and if I believe I can be of assistance to someone I deem suitable, I will provide you with a Calendly link. This will allow you to schedule a time slot that works for both of us.
