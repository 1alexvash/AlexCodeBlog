In the previous article I was revealing my coding insecurities by hating on wordpress.

In this one, I'm actually going to tell you why it actually might be a good solution for your platform at hand.

\# No bad tools

(only ...bad worker or some other quote)

(nailing a nail with screwdriwer?)

So first thing first we need to understand that there are no bad tools, there's a specific tool for every instrument and every problem.

If you're building some complex platform with dozens of custom tailoed components with unique functionality, than a wordpress is a terrible solution for you.

But if you need to build some simple web page, which was built a thousands of times before you then wordpress is a perfect fit for you.

This is what I actually did for some of my clients. I knew they wanted something simple for their business just to test waters. So I recomended WP as a techinical solution, and I actually hired other freelancers to build websites for my clients. As it is extremely popular and most importantly very cheap freelance service, as those people mastered copy and paste skills, so they can create entire wordpress website in just a couple of days.

And the clients were very happy. The end product cost nothing to them, the development service was deliver sooner then they used to, and it just was working.

For good sakes, wordpress has already a tons of YouYube resources, I don't need to educate my client on how to use the system editor, and bill him for the consultation time, I just can send him a couple nicely edited videos. Which are going to save my client even more time.
