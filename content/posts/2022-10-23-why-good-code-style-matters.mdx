Let's imagine we have two guys, one guy has a formatting set to single quotes, and the other for double quotes. Suddenly the second guy needs to work, on the file of the first guy. What's going to happen?

That's right the entire file is going to get reformatted, not a big deal for a small file or project, but a disaster for any decent size project.

So, when this file gets to the code review, it just won't be possible to review anything because the entire file was changed, and it will be extremely hard to find what **actually** has changed. In this case, just **forget** about high-quality code, and code review all together.

### So, what should I do about it?

Just, have any code style convention, your team is comfortable with, and stick to it.

> A team of developers should agree upon a single formatting style, and then every member of that team should use that style. We want the software to have a consistent style. We don’t want it to appear to have been written by a bunch of disagreeing individuals\
> \
> The last thing we want to do is add more complexity to the source code by writing it in a jumble of different individual styles.\

### But don't be original

When it comes to the code style, just use standard recommended options, don't imagine or create your own stuff just because it looks cool for you, because it's likely not. Let's take for example line length. The [prettier documentation](https://prettier.io/docs/en/options.html) suggests 80 characters per line at max. Though it is common for inexperienced developers, including myself when I just was starting out, to write those long horizontal lines.

### So, why lines should be short?

There are, some clear benefits like better structure, limiting complexity of a single line, so the code is not so mentally taxing for the brain.

Did you ever wonder why you read so fast with this tool? It's because your eyes don't have to make unnecessary eye movements.

How we read a normal text:

So, as you can see that the eye travels a lot, and the longer the line, the more it has to travel to read the text, and less efficient reading feels.

Final example, on what mode do you read text on your phone?
