This book is not about programming, and it is a programming blog.

So why this book is in here? Good question, indeed, because this book is about mindset, and the right mindset is more important than everything.

If you got the wrong mindset in life, you are basically screwed, you're going to be challenged by basic the most insignificant obstacles.

But if you've got the right mindset, you'll be able to uplift and inspire yourself for the most challenging tasks, and not, a single obstacle will offset you from the course.

So enough of pep talk, it's time for discussion of the key ideas of the book.

## Key idea #1: Passion is a BS

The author claims that passion is BS because we are not born for doing something, as we age our interest can change, and that's okay. I mean you can be a professional ⚽ football player, you can have a gift and genetics for it, but is it something you are meant to do from the day you were born, until the day you die? Uh, does not sound too exciting for me, I'd rather have a life, where I can pick, and try plenty of occupations.

So how the **passion** actually **works**? The word itself is kind of funny because just a few decades ago we didn't use it all, but now we've got this sudden craze where's everybody got to be passionate about something. You can be passionate about watching 📺 Netflix all day long, or playing 🎮 video games, but those activities won't ever likely to pay the bills.

The general way passion gets formed is when we start doing something, we notice that we are good at it, then we get complimented for being good, then we feel good about the behavior itself, and we're inclined to repeat the habit, after repeating the cycle we are feeling better and better about it, it's a ♾ perpetual cycle by now.

You know you would not likely to attend the 💪 gym for the second time if during your first time you could not lift a single thing. It's not like I say you can't improve, but I can speculate if you weren't born with great 🎨 painting skills by default neither, you did really ever take the time to improve them. **Nobody gets motivated and driven by being lame**.

## Key idea #2: Career capital

Cool, so how does it relate to programming? Programming is kind of funny, because you don't need some 🧬 genetics or talent for it, you just need a desire for hard work, dedication, and some time to develop your skills.

When you are starting out your career journey, it can be tough, the competition to land that first job can be fierce, and it can be very easy to get disappointed, as there's none of the positive reinforcement.

But, it's a totally different story, once you do get that experience, now companies are the ones looking for you, and you're in the position of being picky, while you check and rejects those offers.

Though getting there takes ⌚ time, and persistence.

## Key idea #3: Gain control

People like having control in their life, people love when their opinion gets respected, but to get there you need to put some work.

You probably aren't going to enjoy your 👨‍💼 internship much, when every second there's a chance of you getting fired just by hearing a bad word from your 👩‍💼 superior. It's a stressful, and anxious situation to be in because you experience a limited control over the situation.

But it is a whole different story, when you are a superior, you are the one to get pleased, get to pick who works on what, you're in power, and in command. It feels good when people respect us, being at the top of hierarchy makes our 🐵 chimpanzee brain feel good and happy.

When people text you, and ask you something every 10 minute, it can feel annoying for being responsible for resolving their problems, but at the same very time it feels good. At least in your 🧠 brain you know that you are hella important.  
(And when you do help out others, at least you know that you are probably not the first on the 📃 firing list, because without you the whole system will go out of 🚂 rails, and bosses don't like that stress like any other people)

Sounds good, yep? You just need to keep in mind, that nobody gets born a shot caller, you need to grow and become one, so take your step, and enjoy your 🛣 journey.

## Summary:

As you can see, I did enjoy the book from the review, I really liked the core ideas in it. The book itself is short, and straight to the point. I want to conclude with the following quote:

> "Don't hate the players, hate the game"

Life is not fair, but by being able to better understand the game you will have higher chances of success, and this book is just about that.
