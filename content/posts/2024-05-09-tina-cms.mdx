Backstory: prior to Tina CMS on this blog, I tried WordPress and Netlify CMS, and in short, they both suck.

I mean, Tina CMS is still not perfect, as it has a couple of flaws I am going to describe further down in this article, but still, it has one killer feature that makes all the difference.

### Summary

In summary, I reimplemented my website 3 times, first time I created a WordPress, but it was too heavy, had too many features, and it did not work the way I expected. Next I went into trying [Netlify CMS](https://alex-code.com/post/2023-06-06-why-you-should-not-use-netlify-cms) which promised a minimalistic interface, but even despite having only a few features in its core, still struggled to deliver them.

So my encounter with Tina CMS was a perfect match in heaven, even despite its occasional flaws here and there, it is still perfect for me
