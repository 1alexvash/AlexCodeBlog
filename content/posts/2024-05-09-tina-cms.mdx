Backstory: prior to Tina CMS on this blog, I tried WordPress and Netlify CMS, and in short, they both suck.

I mean, Tina CMS is still not perfect, as it has a couple of flaws I am going to describe further down in this article, but still, it has one killer feature that makes all the difference.

### What sucks

Despite, it's core feature which really carries the overall impression of TinaCMS it still has a few nuances here, and there are a few nuances that make it not so perfect.

And here they are:

1. Despite being based on the React platform, it still not as easy in terms of integration as the forementioned NetlifyCMS
2. TypeScript is not a first class citizen inside TinaCMS, so if your project is based on React + TypeScript stack you are going to have a fun time extracting those types which will make the existing integration even harder.
3. It has a few weird bugs, one of them is when you write an article and accidentally close the tab. It closes the page without any warning about lost progress. I did report this bug a long time ago inside the community, but they don't seem to fix it any time soon.
4. There are a couple of issues with renaming I did report as well, for example, when you rename a file, and it has invalid characters or there's a file with a similar name. The website just crashes, instead of just giving a beautiful validation error in advance.

### Summary

In summary, I reimplemented my website 3 times, first time I created a WordPress, but it was too heavy, had too many features, and it did not work the way I expected. Next I went into trying [Netlify CMS](https://alex-code.com/post/2023-06-06-why-you-should-not-use-netlify-cms) which promised a minimalistic interface, but even despite having only a few features in its core, still struggled to deliver them.

So my encounter with Tina CMS was a perfect match in heaven, even despite its occasional flaws here and there, it is still perfect for me
