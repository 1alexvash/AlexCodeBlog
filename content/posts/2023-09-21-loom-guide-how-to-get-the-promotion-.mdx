[Loom](https://www.loom.com/) is the greatest app to save your time or time of your lead üë®‚Äçüíª With Loom, you can create video recordings of your screen or yourself.

### Speed and Clarity

The main benefit of using Loom is the ability to introduce information in a more understandable variant than traditional text-based communication. 

With this application you don't need to do this hard routine to share your video like: record your video, upload to your drive and share the access to another person which need to download your video and spend many time ü§Ø

Let's imagine another case: you need to introduce your work or interesting feature to 4+ colleagues. You need to choose the time when everyone can join to the meeting and let see how much it will cost for example:

Using Loom you can miss this and save many money.

When you record a video using Loom, you can provide context, demonstrate processes,  and quickly share them through easily accessible links. This visual and auditory engagement allows your audience to grasp the information more quickly and comprehensively.

### Enhancing Your Professional Profile

When you save time of your colleagues  you become more perspective and pleasant at work than others workers. Saving time for both yourself and your audience has a ripple effect on your professional image. When you consistently use Loom to efficiently convey information, you become a standout professional who values effective communication and respects others' time.
