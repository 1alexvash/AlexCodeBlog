Loom is the application which can change and optimize your routine. In the main page of [Loom](https://www.loom.com/), you can see the cute demo of using and interesting phrase: "One video is worth a thousand words. Easily record and share AI-powered video messages with your teammates and customers to supercharge productivity". But does this app live up to its description? I suggest to consider all the benefits of this app.

### Record video content faster and simple

When you record a video using Loom, you can provide context and demonstrate processes ðŸ’ª But why you need to use Loom and not other recording software or video publish platform?

Let's compare with popular platform YouTube: to create the video and share to your teammates you need to find the app which will be recording the video without watermarks, after you need to upload your video to platform and do some steps like create the title and description for your video. It's gonna take a long time. In Loom you don't need to do this routine, this app includes and optimize all this steps. Only what you need is start recording and Loom will do all routine steps for you. The demo how the Loom video looks: [Demo](https://www.loom.com/community/product-demo)

For sure, in Loom you can use cute feature like comments. Providing detailed feedback in live meetings can be difficult. Using Loom to record feedback gives you more time to review a project and respond with your thoughts. Recording project feedback adds tone and nuance in a way text-only comments canâ€™t.Â 

Read more about the feedback you can read [here](https://www.loom.com/give-feedback). 

### Accesible links

When you have recorded the video in Loom you can quickly share them via easily accessible links. This eliminates the routine chore of publishing videos to various video platforms. 

### Use cases

You can use Loom in the different spheres and cases like education, engineering or optimize the communication with your teem. All use cases you can see in this [page](https://www.loom.com/use-case).

Like the the example where Loom can be useful is to replace the daily meetings to short video demos. 

Scheduling a live meeting across time zones is difficult. With Loom, async project feedback can be delivered anywhere at anytime. Like another disadvantage of live meeting is the cost. The example how much it can be:

### Bottom line

Loom is an invaluable tool for anyone looking to streamline communication, save time, and enhance their professional image.
