Let's start with the pain.

Meetings are fucking expensive.

@illustration

Not only that, scheduling them is a pain in itself.

> Person A: Hi there! I'd like to schedule a meeting to discuss the project next week. How about Tuesday at 2 PM?\
> \
> Person B: Hi! Unfortunately, I have another meeting scheduled at that time. How about Wednesday morning?\
> \
> Person A: Wednesday morning is tricky for me. How about Thursday afternoon?\
> \
> Person B: I have a client presentation scheduled for Thursday afternoon. How about Friday morning?\
> \
> Person A: Friday morning doesn't work for me either. This is tougher than I thought. How about looking at the following week?\
> \
> Person B: I'm traveling the following week. Maybe we can try for an evening slot?\
> \
> Person A: Evenings are usually packed for me. Let's see... How about the week after next?\
> \
> Person B: That sounds good. Let's aim for Monday afternoon, two weeks from now.\
> \
> Person A: Perfect! Let's lock it in. Thanks for your flexibility!\
> \
> Person B: No problem at all. Looking forward to our discussion then!

And [Loom](https://www.loom.com/) comes with the solution,  it is called **async** **communication**.

You might be like, "What the fuck is async communication".

It is basically when you open the Loom app, press screen record, Loom automatically uploads this video on their service, and gives you a sharable URL link.

You might think, well, this is kind of basic, and there's nothing much about this service. If you think so, you are dead wrong.

In reality, it is a package of services. Video recording is only an icing on top of the cake, as you are automatically given an online storage to store those videos and this alone saves will you a ton of time, as you won't have to find some terrible unreliable place to store your video.

You just press the record, then press finish, and then the next second you'll be given a sharable URL with already uploaded video.

It just a plain magic.

And this is not where it ends, as the Loom, has additional perks, it has a very nice video player, which is an expected thing, but so many websites fuck it up that it kind of gets unexpected to get a basic working video player where you can change the playback speed for example to watch at the speed of your comfort.

Also, it has the AI filters to clean the dead air and filter words, so your videos become even shorter and more succinct to the bottom of things you were trying to say.

Additionally, your video is followed by your video camera in the corner, so viewers can also pick up your body language, for better communication, small thing, but makes a massive difference.

And finally, there are additional comments feature, so your viewers can reply at the specific moment of the video to give you a necessary input.

When you go to try the async communication, you can't really go back to the old ways of the path, as you record at the convenient time for you, your viewers watch at the convenient time for them, you both don't waste time on scheduling, and just solve simple worky task quicker.

The Loom tool was a game changer for my management line of work, as I was able to dodge plenty of meetings by recording quick videos.

You can see more cases of Loom usage in here: [https://www.loom.com/use-case/engineering](https://www.loom.com/use-case/engineering)

Overall, a lot of good was said about the Loom in this article, but there's one caveat I need to mention. It has a bit strict free tier, so if you are about to use it seriously you are likely going to need to pay for this tool, but on the positive note I'll say it's going to yield big productivity gains.
