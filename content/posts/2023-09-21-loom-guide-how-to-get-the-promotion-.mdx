[Loom](https://www.loom.com/) is the greatest app to save your time or time of your lead üë®‚Äçüíª With Loom, you can create video recordings of your screen or yourself.

### Speed and Clarity

The main benefit of using Loom is the ability to introduce information in a more understandable variant than traditional text-based communication. 

This application eliminates the need for the hard process of sharing videos, which typically involves recording, uploading to your drive, and then sharing access with others who must download the video, resulting in a significant time investment ü§Ø.

Let's consider another scenario: you need to present your work or an interesting feature to 4+ colleagues. You would typically have to coordinate a meeting time that accommodates everyone and calculate the potential costs, for example:

Saving time for both yourself and your audience has a ripple effect on your professional image.
