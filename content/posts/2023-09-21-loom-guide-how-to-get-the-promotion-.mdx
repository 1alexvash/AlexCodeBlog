Let's start with the pain.

Meetings are fucking expensive.

@illustration

Not only that, scheduling them is a pain in itself.

> Person A: Hi there! I'd like to schedule a meeting to discuss the project next week. How about Tuesday at 2 PM?\
> \
> Person B: Hi! Unfortunately, I have another meeting scheduled at that time. How about Wednesday morning?\
> \
> Person A: Wednesday morning is tricky for me. How about Thursday afternoon?\
> \
> Person B: I have a client presentation scheduled for Thursday afternoon. How about Friday morning?\
> \
> Person A: Friday morning doesn't work for me either. This is tougher than I thought. How about looking at the following week?\
> \
> Person B: I'm traveling the following week. Maybe we can try for an evening slot?\
> \
> Person A: Evenings are usually packed for me. Let's see... How about the week after next?\
> \
> Person B: That sounds good. Let's aim for Monday afternoon, two weeks from now.\
> \
> Person A: Perfect! Let's lock it in. Thanks for your flexibility!\
> \
> Person B: No problem at all. Looking forward to our discussion then!
