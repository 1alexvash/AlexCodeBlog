Imagine Sophia. Sophia wants to buy a house, and she needs $200 000 for the down payment, and she's trying to estimate how long it will take her to save up the needed sum of money.

For context, Sophia already has $50 000 already saved up, and she can save $10 000 / year, also all her money is invested, and she's consistently getting a 10% yearly yield.

So initially, she has the $50K. The next year she has $5K of interest + $10K from savings with a total of $65K for this year, and the next year she's going to have $6.5K of interest, and from there the calculation gets more and more complex.

The problem like this might be hard to solve if you don't know the recursion pattern because it is not your traditional `for loop` as you don't really know where it is going to end.

Recursion in a nutshell is basically a function calling itself until a certain condition is met. For the sake of simplicity, just basically imagine a üêç snake trying to bite itself, this is how it looks, and this is what we are trying to achieve.

Enough of talking, let's check the code example.

### Example

```javascript
function yearsToAffordTheDownPayment({
  currentSumOfMoney,
  interestRate,
  moneySavedUp,
  downPaymentEndGoal,
  years = 0,
}) {
  const savingGoalIsMet = currentSumOfMoney >= downPaymentEndGoal;

  if (savingGoalIsMet) {
    return { years };
  }

  const updatedSumOfMoney = Math.floor(
    currentSumOfMoney + currentSumOfMoney * (interestRate / 100) + moneySavedUp
  );

  const nextYear = years + 1;

  console.log(
    `Year ${nextYear}: current sum of money $${updatedSumOfMoney} money left to save $${downPaymentEndGoal - updatedSumOfMoney
    }`
  );
  
  // 'Year 1: current sum of money $65000 money left to save $135000'
  // 'Year 2: current sum of money $81500 money left to save $118500'
  // 'Year 3: current sum of money $99650 money left to save $100350'
  // 'Year 4: current sum of money $119615 money left to save $80385'
  // 'Year 5: current sum of money $141576 money left to save $58424'
  // 'Year 6: current sum of money $165733 money left to save $34267'
  // 'Year 7: current sum of money $192306 money left to save $7694'
  // 'Year 8: current sum of money $221536 money left to save $-21536' // ‚úÖ Saving goal is met

  return yearsToAffordTheDownPayment({
    currentSumOfMoney: updatedSumOfMoney,
    interestRate,
    moneySavedUp,
    downPaymentEndGoal,
    years: nextYear,
  });
}

const sophiaInitialConditions = {
  currentSumOfMoney: 50000,
  interestRate: 10,
  moneySavedUp: 10000,
  downPaymentEndGoal: 200000,
};

const result = yearsToAffordTheDownPayment(sophiaInitialConditions);
console.log("result:", result);
// 'result:', { years: 8 }
```

The example is quite lengthy, but I tried to make it as human-readable as humanly possible.

I strongly recommend playing with it yourself to better understand what's going on inside of it; otherwise, that's all on the recursion.  Peace out üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.
