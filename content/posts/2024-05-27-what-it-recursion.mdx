Imagine Sophia. Sophia wants to buy a house, and she needs $200 000 for the down payment, and she's trying to estimate how long it will take her to save up the money.

Additionally, Sophia has $50 000 already saved up, and she can save $10 000 / year, also all her money is invested, and she's consistently getting a 10% yearly yield.

The problem like this is really hard to solve if you don't know the recursion pattern because it is not your traditional `for loop` as you don't really know where it is going to end.

Recursion in a nutshell is basically a function calling itself until a certain condition is met. For the sake of simplicity, just basically imagine a üêç snake trying to bite itself, this is how it looks, and this is what we are trying to achieve

### Example

@find codewars example and provide the code

@write some placeholder code, of what is happening year by year

@illustration example, do I need an illustration?
