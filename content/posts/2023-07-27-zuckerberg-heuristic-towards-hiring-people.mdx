Recently, I was listening to a fresh Lex Fridman's podcast featuring Mark Zuckerberg, and I found one fragment on hiring deserving an entire article, as there's so much ðŸ’Ž value in it.

And it is always interesting to hear an opinion from the CEO of the FAANG company with thousands of employees, so here's the quote itself.

> I think when an organization has grown quickly, one of the big questions that teams face is, do I hire this person who's in front of me now because they seem good, or do I hold out to get someone who's even better?\
> \
> And the heuristic that I always focused on for myself and my own kind of direct hiring that I think works when you, when you recurse it through the organization is that **you should only hire someone to be on your team if you would be happy working for them in an alternate universe.**

The whole podcast fragment on hiring is here at [1:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ\&t=6705s)

I really love this heuristic, as I myself made up to 10 hiring decisions in various companies I worked for.

Not every single decision of mine worked out, as I had to make calls to fire some of those people, or they simply did not pass the internship. But those who did, turned out to be great relationships with an exciting experience. Where I would not mind working for this person I hired (in an alternate universe).

The beauty of this heuristic is that it describes perfectly this ðŸŽ‡ magical "click" feeling when you decide to hire somebody.
