Recently, I was listening to a fresh Lex Fridman's podcast featuring Mark Zuckerberg, and I found one fragment on hiring deserving an article, as there's so much value in it.

> I think when an organization has grown quickly, one of the big questions that teams face is, do I hire this person. Who's in front of me now because they seem good, or do I hold out to get someone who's even better?\
> \
> And the heuristic that I always focused on for myself and my own kind of direct hiring that I think works when you, when you recurse it through the organization is that you should only hire someone to be on your team if you would be happy working for them in an alternate universe.

The whole fragment on hiring is here at [1:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ\&t=6705s)
