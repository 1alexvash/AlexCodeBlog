There's this new feature by GitHub that lets you use Visual Studio Code editor inside your repository.

To turn it on, just click dot **.** symbol on your keyboard

Or you can just change a domain name from

github.**com** to => github.**dev**

Good enough for me, at least I won't have to clone the repo to find some line of code.
