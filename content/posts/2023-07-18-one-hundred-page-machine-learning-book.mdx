I was guilty of the AI hype train, so I just could not pass this fancy book promising to teach you me some AI basics in this very concise book.

Let's not beat around the bush, and check what's inside â¬‡

And I mean this is the worst part of this book. Every single page looks just like this.

(Not as fun as this meme ðŸ™ƒ though)

To wrap-up this book gives a good general idea of how AI works behind the curtains, but considering its complexity I would not recommend it to somebody without a proper math background, and I wish somebody would have told me it too.
