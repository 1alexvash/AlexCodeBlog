I was guilty of the AI hype train, so I just could not pass this fancy book promising to teach you me some AI basics in this very concise book.

And I mean this is the worst part of this book. Every single page looks just like this.

If you don't have some specific math background, this book will feel just like this:

(Not as fan as this meme ðŸ™ƒ though)

To wrap-up this book gives a good general idea of how AI works behind the curtains, but considering its complexity I would not recommend it to somebody without a proper math background, and wish somebody would tell me too.
