Cloud functions are powerful, and they can help solve many problems.

I'm starting a series in which I'm going to cover different use cases for them, but firstly let's initialize them in our project.

***

**Disclaimer**: to use cloud function service, your
firebase project need to be on the **blaze** plan.

For it, you need to link a credit card in your firebase settings.

Don't worry, firebase has a generous free-tier. You **won't** have to pay for anything.

***

Make sure firebase is installed in your CLI by running this command

```bash
firebase --version
```

Then run to initialize / reinitialize your project

```bash
firebase init
```

Press enter to proceed

Then choose the right service you need

Select your project

Pick your flavor of JavaScript

Answer if you need ESLint, it is opted out by default

Then just press yes to install dependencies.

It is going to create firebase config + functions folder.

So, you're going to see a structure like that.

Let's go to **functions/index.js**

![](/post-images/cloud-7.jpg)

And uncomment the first function, so we can actually test it out.

Now we need to deploy this function to firebase using this command.

```bash
firebase deploy --only functions
```

After deploying. You're going to receive the URL by which you'll be able to call the function.

To test it out. Let's open some shell and run this CURL script

![](/post-images/cloud-10.jpg)

Wow. We've got something working.

In the firebase → functions → logs.

You can see that we did indeed log something by calling this function. We've got 200 success status and execution time. Well, that can have a little bit of use.

That's it for this article, in the next article. We're going to create something a bit more exciting.

A cloud function that returns JSON data.

Stay tuned.
