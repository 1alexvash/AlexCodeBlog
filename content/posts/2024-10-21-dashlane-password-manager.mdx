Dashlane is a password manager, and I'm not really fan of it, as I think Google Password Manager can better do its job for free, unless you have some specific corporate case when you have some convention and need extra layer of security, though in this article I would like to cover another interesting feature of this service.

Generally, password sharing is potentially unsafe operation, but sometimes this is a necessary evil.

Like in the following cases:

1. To give access to your Netflix account to a family member
2. You work for a really small agency, and it can't afford to buy some expensive piece of software or license, so your company just shares passwords
3. Your friend has access to some educational course, and they might give you a glimpse of this course and access to the platform before you decide to buy this course yourself in order to make a more informed decision
4. You play some online game, like for example, you play for an orc while your friend plays for an elf, so with the password sharing you can try what is it like being in the skin of an elf üòÅ
5. Your assistant replies to your business letters

And other cases.

## How it works?

The way Dashlane makes password sharing more secure is via this trick:

Instead of giving the person you share with your real super secure password: `12345678` it creates üóùÔ∏è a hash key like this for example `W97k"M&8` and then verifies whether it's the right key before Chrome extension will grant access to the service, so your friend basically never sees your real password providing an extra layer of security while sharing a password.

That's all about this tool, and it is something interesting I learned this week, so hopefully, this tool might come in handy for you.
