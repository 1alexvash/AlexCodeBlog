Dashlane is a password manager, but I'm not really fan of it, as I think Google Password Manager can better do its job for free, unless you have some specific corporate case when you have some convention and need the extra layer of security, but in this article I would like to cover another interesting feature of this service.

Password sharing is potentially unsafe operation, but sometimes this is unnecessary evil.

Like in the following cases:

1. You work for a small agency, and it can't afford to buy some expensive piece of software, so you share it
2. To give access to your Netflix account to a family member
3. Your friend has access to some educational course, and they might give you a glimpse of this course and access to the platform before you decide to buy this course yourself in order to make a more informed decision
4. You play some online game, you play for an orc while your friend plays for an elf, so with the password sharing you can try what's it like being in the skin of an elf üòÅ
5. Your assistant replies on your business letters

And other cases.

The way Dashlane makes password sharing more secure is via this trick:

Instead of giving the person you share with your real super secure password: `12345678` it creates üóùÔ∏èa hash key like this for example `9n7@Q0k+` and then verifies whether it's the right key before granting access to the service.

That's all about this tool, and is something I interesting I learned this week, so maybe this tool will come in handy for your work.
