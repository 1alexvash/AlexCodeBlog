I was avoiding reading this book for some quite a while, as I had a thought in my mind that this book will promote becoming a super specialist in a particular niche while ignoring the rest of the other areas in your life. I couldn't have been more wrong.

There's a well-known debate subject on succeeding in life, it's called "Generalist vs specialist".

The specialist camp believes in becoming an expert as the easiest path of making it in life. While generalists believe in skill stacking, so for example, you are top 10% in skill one, and top 10% in skill two making you a top 1% in skills in combinations of those two unique skills among the general population.

But, the book wasn't part of this debate, it was about something else, and I'm glad I finally faced my ignorance and picked this book up, as it had a valuable insight.

## The key insight

The core idea of this book, it, is to have a laser focus on one single metric to track your progress.

### Examples:

1. Jake is looking towards landing a software job at Google, and he knows that knowing data algorithms and data structures is a must knowledge during the technical interview process, and there's a simply no way around it. So he decides to pick on one thing that will get this job done, and decides to study on [CodeWars](https://alex-code.com/post/2023-01-21-i-tried-codewars-for-30-days) platform for 5 hours a week for an entire year, as there's simply no way he won't improve his problem-solving skills during this year.

> What's the ONE Thing you can do such that by doing it everything else will be easir or unnessary?

2\) Sophia is getting into her 30s and started noticing a bad trend of weight gains which accrues overtime 

> If you try to do everything, you could wind up with nothing. If you try to do just ONE Thing, the right ONE Thing, you could wind up with everything you ever wanted.

@core idea

@generalist vs specialist, it's not about that

@plenty of fluff otherwise
