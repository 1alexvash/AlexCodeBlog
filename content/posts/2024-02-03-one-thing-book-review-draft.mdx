I was avoiding reading this book for some quite a while, as I had a thought in my mind that this book will promote becoming a super specialist in a particular niche while ignoring the rest of the other areas in your life. I could have been more wrong.

@core idea

@generalist vs specialist, it's not about that

@plenty of fluff otherwise
