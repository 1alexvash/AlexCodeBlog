I was avoiding reading this book for some quite a while, as I had a thought in my mind that this book will promote becoming a super specialist in a particular niche while ignoring the rest of the other areas in your life, and for my luck I couldn't have been more wrong.

There's a well-known debate subject on succeeding in life, it's called "Generalist vs specialist".

The specialist camp believes in becoming an expert as the easiest path of making it in life. While generalists believe in skill stacking, so for example, you are top 10% in skill one, and top 10% in skill two making you a top 1% in skills in combinations of those two unique skills among the general population.

But, the book wasn't part of this debate, it was about something else, and I'm glad I finally faced my ignorance and picked this book up, as it had a valuable insight.

## The key insight

The core idea of this book, it, is to have a laser focus on one single metric to track your progress towards a meaningful goal.

### Examples:

1. Jake is looking towards landing a software job at Google, and he knows that knowing data algorithms and data structures is must knowledge during the technical interview process, and there's a simply no way around it. So he decides to pick on one thing that will get this job done, and decides to study on [CodeWars](https://alex-code.com/post/2023-01-21-i-tried-codewars-for-30-days) platform for 5 hours a week for an entire year, as there's simply no way he won't improve his problem-solving skills during this year.

> What's the ONE Thing you can do such that by doing it everything else will be easir or unnessary?

2\) Sophia is getting into her 30s and started noticing a bad trend of weight gains which accrues overtime, and she doesn't really like it, especially with some history of obesity in her family, so she does a minimal research on dieting and what makes healthy food, and decides to introduce a small portion of a salad in her daily ration of food for 3 months and just see how it goes.

After 3 months, Sophia is pretty happy with her results, and decides to go even further. She plans a summer Italy trip, and wants to be ready for the beach season, so she decides to cut sugary drinks out of her life, and it works amazing for her as she finds her future spouse on that trip.

> If you try to do everything, you could wind up with nothing. If you try to do just ONE Thing, the right ONE Thing, you could wind up with everything you ever wanted.

3\) Jake struggles to get his first software job, but then he gets advice from a good HR friend to send 10 job applications a week no matter what, and then he sticks with the plan.

4\) John is discontent with the fact that his teenage son is very distant towards him, so he offers him a couple of weekends activities to get together.

5\) Oliver is overwhelmed with a sudden AI trend, and he decides to familiarize himself with the subject until it eventually clicks, so he chooses to read one AI book this month, if it doesn't work, he'll pick another book the next month, if it doesn't work as well, he'll find some course on AI and try learning this way.

## Summary

After reading hundreds of books in my life, it's getting harder and harder to extract the new knowledge, so I really liked the core idea of ONE thing by learning something valuable.

As otherwise, a very simple idea, it has very powerful applications.

By eliminating what's unnecessary, you are able to channel your energy in the right direction, and by finding what's necessary, and a single key metric to work on, you are essentially making the success inevitable.
