Tim Ferris, if you already don't know, is an author of "The Tim Ferriss Show", a popular podcast where he interviews a variety of successful people from all walks of life, and fields of work.

The book contains very brief summaries of 200 of those interviews from many successful people like: Tony Robbins, Peter Thiel, Arnold Schwarzenegger, and many others.

There are plenty of golden nuggets of wisdom and useful information in it.

If you are into this kind of reading and like learning from successful people in a bite sized format, then this ðŸ“š book is for you.

But what struck me though, and the very reason I'm writing this blog post, is this idea of mortality which was coming across many interviews.

Many successful people think about death, they accept it, and don't hide or ignore it.

And I think it can explain the reason for their success in the first place, when you live like this, when you appreciate the moment, make every second count, and don't waste your life, success just becomes inevitable.

If you are curious, then I'm going to leave you with one more extract from this book

> "The Tail End" by Tim Urban on the Wait But Why blog - if you only read on article this month, make it that one.
